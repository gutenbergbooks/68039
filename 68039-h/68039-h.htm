  <div class="subheadc">THE STUARTS—JAMES <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> Nichols’s “Progresses,” that mine of information regarding James
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, his court and times, it is related that James paid his first visit
    to the Tower on 3rd May 1603, “when His Majesty set forward from the
    Charter House and went quietly on horseback to Whitehall where he
    took barge. Having shot the bridge, his present landing was expected
    at the Tower stayres, but it pleased His Highness to passe the Towre
    stairs toward St Katherines, and there stayed on the water to see the
    ordinance on the White Tower (commonly called Julius Cæsar’s Tower)
    being in number twenty pieces, with the great ordinance on the Towre
    wharfe, being in number 100, and chalmers to the number of 130,
    discharged and shot off. Of which, all services were sufficiently
    performed by the gunners, that a peale of so good order was never heard
    before; which was most commendable to all sorts, and very acceptable to
    the King.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

  <p>Owing to the plague then raging in London, the customary procession
    at the coronation was omitted, although the King rode in state from
    the Tower to Westminster, preparatory to the opening of his first
    Parliament on 15th of March 1605, as the Londoners had made their
    welcome for him ready. In Mr Sidney Lee’s “Life of Shakespeare,” he
    states that Shakespeare, with eight other players of the King’s company
    of actors, “walked from the Tower of London to Westminster in the
    procession which accompanied the King in his formal entry into London.
    Each actor received four and a half yards of scarlet cloth to wear as
    a cloak on the occasion, and in the document authorising the grant,
    Shakespeare’s name stands first on the list.” This is the only time
    that we can positively know that Shakespeare was ever at the Tower; but
    his frequent introduction of the fortress into his historical dramas
    makes it certain that he must often have visited a place so full of
    dramatic episodes and historical memories.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>Four months earlier, while staying at Wilton, news had reached James
    of a plot to place the crown upon the head of Lady Arabella Stuart,
    and a large batch of alleged conspirators were taken to the Tower in
    consequence. Among them was Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Cobham, and his
    brother, George Brooke, Thomas Lord Grey <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>de Wilton, Sir Griffin
    Maskham, Sir Edward Parham, Bartholomew Brookesby, Anthony Copley, and
    two priests named Weston and Clarke. This conspiracy, if it deserves
    the name, and for which Raleigh was for the second time sent to the
    Tower, owed its existence to the unlucky Arabella, daughter of Charles
    Stuart, Earl of Lennox, younger brother of Darnley, and consequently
    James’s first cousin on the mother’s side.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_002">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_002.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>State Procession from the Tower in the days of the Stuarts.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Arabella Stuart was also related to the Tudors, and this double
    relationship to the reigning sovereign and to the late Queen was her
    greatest misfortune, and the cause of her untimely death. She appears
    to have been amiable, refined, virtuous, and good-looking, but of a
    somewhat frail physique and countenance, to judge by the excellent
    miniature which Oliver painted of her. That her mind was not a strong
    one is very evident, and one cannot be surprised that she became insane
    under the burden of her misfortunes.</p>

  <p>Lady Arabella was made use of as a tool by James’s enemies, and at
    Lord Cobham’s trial it was conclusively proved that she had no share
    in any of the schemes which had the placing of herself on the throne
    for their object. Had it not been for her unfortunate marriage she
    would probably have ended her life in peaceful obscurity. This unhappy
    lady disliked the life of a court, and had lived principally with
    her grandmother, old Lady Shrewsbury, “Bess of Hardwicke,” as that
    much-married and firm-minded dame was nicknamed, in her beautiful homes
    of Chatsworth and Hardwicke Hall, in Derbyshire. In the last year of
    Elizabeth’s reign, Arabella, whose hand had been asked in marriage by
    many suitors, and amongst them by Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> of France, and the Archduke
    Mathias, met, and fell in love with William Seymour, grandson of the
    Earl of Hertford, and had been kept in close confinement by the Queen
    in consequence.</p>

  <p>The plot to place Lady Arabella on the throne was regarded as dangerous
    by the court, owing to James’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> unpopularity, which was not surprising,
    for at that time everything Scottish was cordially detested by the
    English. The Scotch had been as inimical to us as either the French
    or the Spaniards, and for a far longer period, whilst the Scottish
    alliance with France had added still more to the national dislike.
    Neither was the new King’s appearance one to win the admiration of his
    new subjects, for a more ungainly individual had surely never appeared
    out of a booth at a fair. The English were as susceptible then, as
    they are now, to the outward appearance of their rulers, and even
    Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, for all his tyranny and cruelty, was popular among the
    people on account of his fine presence; and when Elizabeth appeared in
    public, all aglow with splendour, her lieges shouted themselves hoarse
    with delight, and worshipped that “bright occidental effulgence.” What
    a contrast to these was James Stuart. With his huge head, and padded
    shanks, his great tongue lolling from out his mouth, his goggle eyes,
    and rolling gait, and the incomprehensible, to English ears, jargon of
    Lowland Scotch which he spoke, his was not a very kingly figure, and
    he made anything but a favourable impression upon his new subjects. It
    appears that Raleigh, at the time of James’s arrival, let fall some
    remarks which were repeated to the King, to the effect that it would be
    well not to allow the Scottish locusts to eat too much of the Southern
    pastures. It has been supposed that Raleigh, at a meeting at Whitehall,
    proposed to found a republic, and Aubrey, a contemporary writer, even
    gives his words, “Let us keep the staff in our own hands, and set up
    a commonwealth, and not remain subject to a needy beggarly nation.”
    Raleigh met the King for the first time at Burleigh, when James, who
    prided himself on his wit, said to Sir Walter, that he thought but
    “rawly” of him; it is a vile pun, but is interesting as showing the way
    in which his contemporaries pronounced Raleigh’s name.</p>

  <p>Cecil, who had brought Essex to the scaffold, now lost no time in
    bringing Raleigh, Essex’s rival, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> Tower, and on the 20th of
    July 1603, the prison gates of that fortress once again closed upon
    the founder of Virginia, on a charge of treason, based on the Arabella
    Stuart conspiracy, nor did they open for him until twelve years had
    passed. On the following day Raleigh attempted to stab himself with
    a table-knife, for he seems to have been maddened by his treatment
    by James and Cecil. In November the plague was so violent in London,
    that the Law Courts were transferred to Winchester, and it was to that
    city that Sir Walter and his fellow-prisoners were taken and tried on
    a charge of “attempting to deprive the King of his crown and dignity;
    to molest the Government, and alter the true religion established in
    England, and to levy war against the King.”</p>

  <p>George Brooke, a brother of Lord Cobham’s, and two priests were found
    guilty and executed, Lords Grey de Wilton, Cobham, and Raleigh were
    respited, and were taken back to their prison in the Tower. Cobham
    never regained his liberty, he was a ruined man, and died probably in
    the Tower. The place of his burial is unknown.</p>

  <p>The de Cobhams were an early family of importance in the twelfth
    century, and from the thirteenth to the sixteenth one of the most
    powerful in the south of England. Henry de Cobham was summoned to
    Parliament in 1313. The direct line ended in Joan de Cobham, who
    married five times; her third husband was Sir John Oldcastle, commonly
    called Lord Cobham, <i lang="la">jure uxoris</i>, but inaccurately, for he was
    summoned to Parliament under his own name, Oldcastle.</p>

  <p>In descent from Joan was Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham, attainted first of
    James the First. He was born 1564, and succeeded to the title 1596–7,
    and shortly after installed Knight of the Garter. He married Francis
    Howard, daughter of the Earl of Nottingham, and widow of the Earl of
    Kildare. He was committed to the Tower December 16th, 1603, tried, and
    condemned to death, and actually brought out to be executed, but had
    been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> privately reprieved beforehand by James the First, who played
    with Cobham and Gray, and their companions, as a cat would with mice.
    After fifteen years’ rigorous confinement in the Tower, his health
    failed, and he was allowed out, attended by his gaolers, to visit Bath.
    This was in 1617, and was taken so ill on his way back he had to stay
    at Odiham, Hants, at the house of his brother-in-law, Sir Edward Moore.
    He died, with very little doubt, in the Tower, January 24th, 1619,
    but the place of his burial has been undiscovered. He had been well
    supplied with books, for the Lieutenant of the Tower seized a thousand
    volumes at the time of his death of “all learning and languages.” In a
    letter from Sir Thomas Wynne to Sir Dudley Carlton (State Papers, Dom
    Jac, 1st vol., 105), 28th of January 1619, occurs this passage: “My
    Lord Cobham is dead, and lyeth unburied as yet for want of money; he
    died a papist.” This probably was only gossip. While in the Tower he
    was allowed eight pounds a week for maintenance, but very little of
    this ever reached him, it probably was absorbed by his keepers and the
    Lieutenant. During his long imprisonment Lady Kildare never troubled
    herself further about him. She lived comfortably, first at Cobham, and
    afterwards at Copthall, Essex.</p>

  <p>By the will of George, Lord Cobham, 1552, the Cobham estates, by an
    elaborate settlement, were strictly entailed, so that Henry, Lord
    Cobham, only had a life interest, and the King could not seize them;
    and probably it was to that fact he owed his life, for the King could
    possess them during his life, but not alienate them.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the next heir was the son of George Brooke, executed for
    treason at Winchester, Lord Cobham’s brother, who, at the time of his
    uncle’s death, was an infant of tender age, and without friends, so
    negotiations were carried on with the next in succession, Duke Brooke,
    a cousin of Lord Cobham’s, and this man parted with his prospective
    rights to the King for about £10,000, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>enabled this “specimen
    of King craft” to enter into possession. Duke Brooke, dying soon after,
    Charles Brooke, his brother, parted with several other manors to Cecil,
    Earl of Salisbury. None of these transactions were legal; Henry, Lord
    Cobham, was not dead, nor the children of George Brooke, William, and
    his two sisters, Frances and Elizabeth. For some reason they were
    “restored in blood,” but with the express proviso they should not
    inherit any of the property of their fathers or their uncles; nor was
    William to take the title of Lord Cobham. And this was all done with
    the connivance of Cecil, Lord Burleigh, brother-in-law to Henry, Lord
    Cobham. No wonder William Brooke became a devoted Parliamentarian in
    the next reign, and died fighting against the King at Newbury, 1643.
    Many letters of Henry Brooke have been preserved while in the Tower:
    “To my very good Lord and Brother-in-law, Lord Burleigh.” He must both
    have been clever and learned, for during his captivity he translated
    Seneca’s treatises, <cite>De Providentia, De Ira, De Tranquilitate, De
    Vita Beata, and De Paupertate</cite>: the original manuscript of one,
    <cite>De Providentia</cite>, is in the library at Ufford Place, Suffolk,
    the seat of his representative, Edward Brooke, Esq., written in a
    beautifully fine hand. Raleigh and Cobham’s “treason” was that known as
    the Main or Spanish Treason, one of the supposed objects of which was
    to place the Lady Arabella Stuart on the throne.</p>

  <p>Lord Grey de Wilton, a young man of great promise, died in St Thomas’s
    Tower in 1617, after passing nine years in the Brick Tower. Lord Grey
    had made an eloquent defence during his trial, which lasted from eight
    in the morning until eight at night, during which, according to the
    Hardwicke State Papers, many “subtle traverses and escapes,” took
    place. When Grey was asked why judgment of death should not be passed
    against him, he replied, “I have nothing to say.” Then he paused a
    little, and added, “And yet a word of Tacitus comes into my mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> ‘non
    eadem omnibus decora,’ the house of the Wiltons have spent many lives
    in their Princes’ service and Grey cannot beg his.”</p>

  <p>For the next twelve years the Tower was Raleigh’s home, and not till he
    had succeeded in bribing King James’s favourite, George Villiers, Duke
    of Buckingham, by the payment of a large sum of money, did he again
    obtain his liberty. Before settling down in the Tower, and while the
    plague was still raging, Raleigh, with his wife and son, were taken to
    the Fleet Prison on several occasions. At length they were placed in
    the not uncomfortable rooms in the Bloody Tower, which he, with his
    family and servants, must have quite filled, for besides Lady Raleigh
    and her son Carew, there were two servants named Dean and Talbot, and
    a boy, who was probably a son of Talbot’s. Their imprisonment was not
    absolutely rigid, for they were allowed the visits of a clergyman named
    Hawthorne, a doctor, Turner, and a surgeon, Dr John, as well as those
    of Sir Walter’s agent, who came up from Raleigh’s place, Sherborn,
    so that he was kept in touch with his affairs; one or two other
    friends were also admitted. In addition to these privileges Sir Walter
    was allowed the run—the liberty as it would be called then—of the
    Lieutenant of the Tower’s garden, which lay at the foot of the Bloody
    Tower, as has already been mentioned in the description of that place.</p>

  <p>In 1604 the penal laws against the Roman Catholics were re-enacted
    by Parliament, and in the following year the famous Gunpowder Plot
    was discovered, with the consequence that in the month of November
    of that year the Tower received many of the principal conspirators,
    and still more of those individuals who were in some way or other
    concerned in it. Foremost amongst the latter were the aged Earl of
    Northumberland, Henry Percy, and with him were Henry, Lord Mordaunt,
    Lord Stourton, and three Jesuit priests, Fathers Garnet, Oldcorn, and
    Gerrard. Northumberland, besides having to pay an enormous fine, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>was
    kept a prisoner in the Tower for sixteen years; Mordaunt and Stourton
    were also heavily fined and remanded to the fortress during the King’s
    pleasure; Fathers Garnet and Oldcorn were hanged—the former at St
    Paul’s, in the usual manner, after being cruelly tortured, the latter
    at Worcester. As for the third priest, Gerrard, I have in another part
    of this work described the treatment he endured and his escape from the
    Tower.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_008">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Byward Tower and Moat from the Wharf</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Of the active conspirators, besides Guy Fawkes—who was executed with
    Thomas Winter, Rookwood, and Keyes in Old Palace Yard—Sir Everard
    Digby, the father of the accomplished Sir Kenelm, Robert Winter,
    Grant, and Bates, were drawn on hurdles to the west end of St Paul’s
    Churchyard, where they were done to death in the approved fashion of
    execution for high treason.</p>

  <p>Guy Fawkes and most of his fellow-prisoners while in the Tower had been
    placed in the subterranean dungeons beneath the White Tower. Fawkes,
    besides being tortured by the rack, was placed in “Little Ease,” in
    which horrible hole he is supposed to have been kept for fifty days.
    Father Oldcorn was imprisoned in the lower room of the Bloody Tower,
    whilst Father Fisher was in the White Tower; Northumberland, the
    “Wizard Earl,” as he was called on account of his leaning towards
    chemical experiments, was lodged in the Martin Tower.</p>

  <p>Until the month of August in that year (1605), Sir Walter Raleigh’s
    imprisonment in the Bloody Tower had not been very stringent. Sir
    George Harvey had filled the position of Lieutenant of the Tower, and
    Sir George and Sir Walter were on friendly terms. His lodging, for a
    prison, was comfortable enough; his wife and son were still with him,
    Lady Raleigh having been confined of a second son about this time.
    In addition to the attendance of his servants and the visits of his
    friends, as I have mentioned before, he was allowed to have all the
    books he required for the great literary labour that now began to
    occupy much of his time. When not working in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> little garden by the
    Tower, or experimenting with his chemicals and decoctions in a small
    outbuilding which he had built in the garden, or taking exercise on the
    wall terrace which overlooked the wharf and the river beyond, he would
    be writing at his “History of the World,” that wonderful fragment which
    is one of the marvels of our literature.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Sir Walter, his friend Sir George Harvey, with whom
    he often dined and passed the evening, ceased being Lieutenant at this
    time, being succeeded by Sir William Waad. Raleigh’s feelings towards
    the new Lieutenant appear to have resembled those of Napoleon to Sir
    Hudson Lowe. Waad, who had been Clerk of the Council, on his side seems
    to have had a personal dislike to the great captive over whom he was
    placed in charge, and to have done all he could—and he had the power of
    doing a great deal—to render Raleigh’s life as unpleasant and galling
    as possible. For instance, Waad ordered a brick wall to be built in
    front of the terrace where Raleigh walked, so that the captive could
    no longer watch the passing life beneath him on the wharf or river.
    Then Waad complained to Cecil of Raleigh making himself too conspicuous
    to the people who passed beneath the Bloody Tower, and, not content
    with annoying Sir Walter, pestered Lady Raleigh, and deprived her of
    the poor satisfaction of driving her coach into the courtyard of the
    fortress, a privilege that had hitherto been allowed her. In these and
    many other petty ways the new Lieutenant contrived to make himself as
    unpleasant as he possibly could to Raleigh and his wife.</p>

  <p>During the alarm consequent upon the Gunpowder Plot, Raleigh was
    examined by the Council, probably in the Lieutenant’s, now the King’s
    House, but naturally nothing could be found to implicate him with the
    conspiracy, and the King had to bide his time before he could bring
    his great subject to the block. In 1610, for some unknown reason, Sir
    Walter was kept a close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> prisoner in his tower for three months, and
    Lady Raleigh was taken from him.</p>

  <p>In Disraeli’s “Amenities of Literature” is the following interesting
    description of those friends of Sir Walter who shared his pursuits and
    studies in the Tower:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“A circumstance as remarkable as the work itself” (“History of the
      World”) “occurred in the author’s long imprisonment. By one of the
      strange coincidences in human affairs, it happened that in the
      Tower Raleigh was surrounded by the highest literary and scientific
      circle in the nation. Henry, the ninth Earl of Northumberland, on
      the suspicion of having favoured his relation Piercy, the Gunpowder
      Plot conspirator, was cast into this State prison, and confined
      during many years. This Earl delighted in what Anthony Wood
      describes as ‘the obscure parts of learning.’ He was a magnificent
      Mecaenas, and not only pensioned scientific men, but daily
      assembled them at his table, and in these intellectual communions,
      participating in their pursuits, he passed his life. His learned
      society was designated as ‘the Atlantis of the Northumberland
      world’! But that world had other inhabitants, antiquaries and
      astrologers, chemists and naturalists. There was seen Thomas
      Allen, another Roger Bacon, ‘terrible and tho’ vulgar,’ famed for
      his ‘Bibliotheca Alleniana,’ a rich collection of manuscripts,
      most of which have been preserved in the Bodleian; the name of
      Allen survives in the ardent commemorations of Camden, of Spelman,
      and of Selden. He was accompanied by his friend Doctor Dee, but
      whether Dee ever tried their patience or their wonder by his
      ‘Diary of Conferences with Spirits’ we find no record, and by the
      astronomical Torporley, a disciple of Lucretius, for his philosophy
      consisted of stones; several of his manuscripts remain in Sion
      College. The muster-roll is too long to run over. In this galaxy of
      the learned the brightest star was Thomas Hariot, who merited the
      distinction of being ‘the Universal Philosopher’; his inventions in
      algebra Descarte, when in England, silently adopted, but which Dr
      Wallis afterwards indignantly reclaimed; his skill in interpreting
      the text of Homer excited the grateful admiration of Chalman when
      occupied by his version. Bishop Corbet has described</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">‘Deep Hariot’s mine</div>
          <div class="i1">In which there is no dross.’</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>“Two other men, Walter Warner, who is said to have suggested to
      Harvey the great discovery of the circulation of the blood, and
      Robert Huer, famed for his ‘Treatise on the Globes’—these, with
      Hariot, were the Earl’s constant companions; and at a period when
      science seemed connected with necromancy, the world distinguished
      the Earl and his three friends as ‘Henry the Wizard and his three
      Magi.’... Such were the men of science, daily guests in the Tower
      during the imprisonment of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>Raleigh; and when he had constructed
      his laboratory to pursue his chemical experiments, he must have
      multiplied their wonders. With one he had been intimately connected
      early in life, Hariot had been his mathematical tutor, was
      domesticated in his house, and became his confidential agent in the
      expedition to Virginia. Raleigh had warmly recommended his friend
      to the Earl of Northumberland, and Sion House became Hariot’s home
      and observatory.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The elder Disraeli has argued that Raleigh could not possibly have
    written the whole of that large tome, “The History of the World,”
    himself, for want of books of reference whilst in the Tower. But as
    his friends supplied him with books, and he himself had probably taken
    copious notes for the work while living in the old home of the Desmonds
    at Youghal, in Ireland, where a remnant of the old Desmond library is
    still existing, the argument can scarcely be considered proved. The
    late Sir John Pope Hennessy has pointed out in his work on “Raleigh in
    Ireland,” that, by an odd coincidence, the son of the sixteenth Earl of
    Desmond, whose lands Raleigh held in Ireland, was a fellow-prisoner of
    Sir Walter’s in the Tower during his first imprisonment in the fortress
    during Elizabeth’s reign. Desmond died in prison in 1608, and was
    buried in St Peter’s Chapel. Raleigh had this youth’s sad fate in his
    mind, it seems, when he wrote from the Tower, “Wee shall be judged as
    we judge—and be dealt withal as wee deal with others in this life, if
    wee believe God Himself.”</p>

  <p>An almost contemporary historian, Sir Richard Baker, refers to
    Raleigh’s imprisonment in the following quaint manner:—“He was kept in
    the Tower, where he had great honour; he spent his time in writing,
    and had been a happy man if he had never been released.” A strange
    description, surely, of what is generally understood by the term,
    “happy man.”</p>

  <p>Henry, Prince of Wales, seems to have been the only member of his
    family who appreciated Sir Walter, frequently visiting him at the
    Tower. On one of the occasions when he had left him, the young prince
    remarked to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>one of his following that no king except his father
    could keep such a bird in such a cage. The Prince’s mother, Queen Anne,
    seems also to have shown some interest in Raleigh’s fate, and to have
    tried to induce her miserable husband to set him free.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Arabella Stuart.</i><br />
      <span class="small">(<i>From a Contemporary Miniature.</i>)</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>In 1611 Arabella Stuart was brought a prisoner into the Tower, and with
    her, Lady Shrewsbury. When the news of Arabella’s marriage with young
    William Seymour reached the King, her fate was sealed, for by this
    marriage the half-captivity in which she had lived was changed into
    captivity for life; and few of James the First’s evil actions, and they
    were not a few, were more mean or cowardly than his treatment of his
    poor kinswoman, Arabella Hertford.</p>

  <p>She had never been known to mix in politics, and if she had any
    ambition, it was the noble ambition of wishing to lead a pure life away
    from an infamous court. Poor Arabella used to declare that although she
    was often asked to marry some foreign prince, nothing on earth would
    induce her to marry any man whom she did not know, or for whom she had
    no liking.</p>

  <p>At Christmastide of 1609, James, hearing a rumour that seemed to point
    to Arabella being married to some foreign prince, had sent her to the
    Tower, releasing her when he discovered that his fears were groundless,
    and giving his consent to her marrying one of his subjects should she
    wish to do so. Unfortunately, Arabella took advantage of the King’s
    consent, trusting to his word, but she found to her bitter cost how
    hollow and false that promise was. In the following February (1610)
    she plighted her troth to William Seymour, both probably relying
    upon the Royal word. Whether James had forgotten that Seymour was a
    probable suitor for Arabella’s hand when he gave his promise cannot
    be known, but Arabella could not have made a more unlucky choice, as
    far as she herself was concerned, for the Suffolk claims had been
    recognised by Act of Parliament; and the same Parliament which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> had
    acknowledged James the First could not alter the order of succession,
    and, consequently, William Seymour being the grandson of Lord Hertford,
    by his wife, Catharine Grey, was in what was called the “Suffolk
    Succession.” His marriage to Arabella brought her still nearer to the
    Crown, and any children born of the marriage would have had a good
    chance of succeeding to the throne.</p>

  <p>The young couple were summoned to appear before the Council, and were
    charged to give up all thoughts of marriage. But, in spite of King
    and Council, they were secretly married in the month of May 1611—a
    month said to be unlucky for marriages. Two months afterwards the news
    reached the King, and the storm burst over the unlucky lovers. Arabella
    was sent a prisoner to Lambeth Palace, and her husband to the Tower.
    From Lambeth Arabella was first removed to the house of Mr Conyers at
    Highgate, and thence she was to be sent to Durham Castle in charge of
    the Bishop. At Highgate, however, she fell ill, or pretended to fall
    ill, and the famous attempt made to escape by herself and her husband
    took place.</p>

  <p>By some means she procured a disguise in the shape of a wig and
    male attire, with long, yellow riding-boots and a rapier, and thus
    accoutred, on the 4th of June she rode to Blackwall, where she had
    hoped to find her husband, but, failing in this, she rowed with a
    female attendant and a Mr Markham, who had accompanied her from
    Highgate, to a French vessel lying near Leigh, which took them on
    board. Seymour, also disguised, escaped from the Tower by following a
    cart laden with wooden billets. He got away unperceived, and managed
    to reach a boat waiting for him by the wharf at the Iron Gate, but, on
    arriving at Leigh, they found the French ship, with Arabella on board,
    had put out to sea. The weather was against the ship in which Seymour
    was sailing making Calais, and he had to go on to Ostend, where he
    disembarked.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a hue and cry rang out from London. King’s messengers
    galloped in hot haste from Whitehall to Deptford, and orders arrived at
    all the southern ports to search all ships and barks that might contain
    the runaways; a proclamation was issued to arrest the principals and
    the abettors of their flight. A ship of war was sent over to Calais,
    and others were despatched along the French coast as far as Flanders
    to intercept the fugitives. When half-way across the Channel, one of
    these vessels, named the <cite>Adventurer</cite>, came in sight of a ship
    crowding on all sail in order to reach Calais; the wind, meanwhile, had
    dropped, and further flight was impossible. A boat was lowered from the
    <cite>Adventurer</cite>, the crew who manned it being armed to the teeth. A
    few shots were exchanged, and the flying vessel, which proved to be
    French, was boarded, and the poor runaway was taken back to the English
    man-of-war; on board of her Arabella was made a prisoner, and as a
    prisoner was landed at the Tower, never to leave it again until her
    luckless body was taken from it for burial at Westminster.</p>

  <p>James made as much ado about this attempted escape of the Hertfords
    as if he had discovered a second Gunpowder Plot. And not only did he
    have all those who had been concerned in Arabella’s flight seized and
    imprisoned in the Tower, but kept the Countess of Shrewsbury and the
    Earl strict prisoners in their house, and ordered the old Earl of
    Hertford to appear before him.</p>

  <p>From all appearances William Seymour showed a lack of courage at
    this time, not unlike the husband of Lady Catherine Seymour in the
    last reign, for he remained abroad while the storm with all its
    fury fell and crushed his young wife. Poor Arabella lingered on in
    her prison till death released her from her troubles on the 25th of
    September 1615. She had been kept both in the Belfry Tower and in the
    Lieutenant’s House, but had lost her reason some time previous to her
    final release both from durance and the world. Her body was taken in
    the dead of night to Westminster Abbey, and placed below the coffin of
    Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> Queen of Scots. Mickle, the author of “Cumnor Hall,” and “There’s
    nae luck about the house,” is credited with having written the touching
    ballad on Arabella Stuart, which is included in Evans’s “Old Ballads.”</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Where London’s Tower its turrets shew,</div>
        <div class="i1">So stately by old Thames’s side,</div>
        <div class="i1">Fair Arabella, child of woe,</div>
        <div class="i1">For many a day had sat and sighed.</div>
        <div class="i1">And as she heard the waves arise,</div>

        <div class="i1">And still so fast her tears did pour.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>William Seymour survived Arabella for nearly half-a-century; he married
    again, his second wife being a sister of the Parliamentary general, the
    Earl of Essex, the son of Elizabeth’s favourite and victim. In 1660
    Seymour became Duke of Somerset, and lived just long enough to welcome
    Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> He had shown far more loyalty to Charles I. than he had
    done to poor Arabella Stuart.</p>

  <p>In 1613, Sir William Waad, to the great delight of Raleigh, as well as
    of the other prisoners in the Tower, vacated his post as Lieutenant. He
    had been charged with the theft of the unfortunate Arabella’s jewels,
    but his dismissal was also connected with a still more tragic story—the
    murder of Sir Thomas Overbury—a murder which throws a very lurid
    light upon the doings of James the First’s court and courtiers. Two
    years before Arabella’s death, the Tower had been the scene of a most
    foul murder. Scandalous as was the court of James, murder had not yet
    been associated with it, but in the year 1613 the fate of Sir Thomas
    Overbury added that dark crime to its other villainies.</p>

  <p>Macaulay has compared the court of James the First to that of Nero; it
    would have been more correct to have likened it to that of the Valois,
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Although it was never proved, there were strong suspicions
    that the somewhat sudden death of Henry, Prince of Wales, was brought
    about by poison, and there is no doubt that poison was made use of by
    James’s courtiers, as the death of Overbury proves. Sir Thomas Overbury
    was the confidant of the King’s worthless favourite, Robert Carr, a
    handsome youth who had been brought by James from Scotland in his
    train, and whom he had knighted in 1607. James had also given Raleigh’s
    confiscated estates to his favourite two years after making him a
    knight, and in 1614 created him Lord Rochester and Earl of Somerset,
    as well as Lord Chamberlain. Overbury belonged to a Gloucestershire
    family, and had travelled on the Continent, whence he returned what
    was then called “a finished gentleman.” Overbury and Carr were firm
    friends, and it was probably on the recommendation of the latter that
    James knighted Overbury in 1608. When, however, Somerset determined
    to marry the notoriously improper Lady Frances Howard, the daughter
    of the Earl of Suffolk, and the girl-wife of Lord Essex, from whom
    she was separated, Overbury most strongly persuaded his friend from
    committing such a rash action. His attitude coming to the knowledge of
    Lady Frances, she vowed to avenge herself upon Sir Thomas, and carried
    her threat to its bitter execution. On some frivolous pretext Overbury
    was sent to the Tower; Lady Somerset, as Lady Frances had become,
    notwithstanding Overbury’s advice, now determined to rid herself of
    the man she mostly feared. With the help of a notorious quack, and of
    a procuress, Mrs Turner, with whom she had been brought up, she set
    about the task of consummating her revenge. Poison was supplied by Mrs
    Turner, with which the unfortunate Overbury was slowly killed; but as
    the drug—it is believed to have been corrosive sublimate—did not act
    sufficiently quickly, two hired assassins, named Franklin and Lobell,
    were called in, and stifled the victim with a pillow. Sir William Waad
    at this time had ceased to be the Lieutenant, through Lady Essex’s
    influence, and had been succeeded by Sir Gervase Elwes, a creature of
    Somerset’s, who was not only cognisant of Overbury’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> death in the
    Bloody Tower, where he was confined, but even aided Lady Somerset in
    her crime. Mrs Turner was the inventor of a peculiar yellow starch
    which was used for stiffening the ruffs worn at that time; she wore one
    of these ruffs when she was sentenced to die for her participation in
    this murder by the Chief-Justice, Sir Edward Coke, and was also hanged
    in it at Tyburn in March 1615, with the natural consequence that yellow
    starched ruffs suddenly ceased to be the fashion. Lady Somerset was
    also tried, and although found guilty of Overbury’s murder, received
    a pardon from the King, but she and her husband, Somerset, spent six
    years as prisoners in the Tower, where they occupied the same rooms in
    the Bloody Tower which shortly before had been tenanted by the wife’s
    victim. Sir Thomas Overbury was buried in St Peter’s Chapel, his grave
    lying next to that of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.</p>

  <p>Prince Henry’s death in 1612 was a terrible loss to Raleigh. The Queen
    had already tasted Sir Walter’s famous cordial or elixir, and when
    her son was given up by the physicians, Anne implored them to try
    Raleigh’s specific medicine, which, according to its inventor, was safe
    to cure all diseases save those produced by poison. Henry was already
    speechless when the elixir was administered to him, but after he had
    swallowed one or two drops he was able to utter a few words before he
    expired. What was the nature of this wonderful mixture of Raleigh’s
    cannot now be ascertained, although Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>’s French physician,
    Le Febre, prepared what was believed to be the actual concoction and
    wrote a treatise upon it. Some of its ingredients were indeed awful,
    the flesh of vipers forming one of them, and it speaks much for the
    strength of James’s Queen that she survived the taking of this terrible physic.</p>

  <p>Raleigh had intended dedicating his history to Prince Henry, but
    after that young Prince’s death he seems to have lost his former
    zest in the work. There is a story <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>told that he threw part of the
    manuscript into the fire on hearing that Walter Burr, the publisher
    of the first edition in 1614, had been a loser by bringing it out.
    Of that first part Mr Hume, in his “Life of Raleigh,” writes, “The
    history, as it exists, is probably the greatest work ever produced
    in captivity, except Don Quixote. The learning contained in it is
    perfectly encyclopædic. Raleigh had always been a lover and a collector
    of books, and had doubtless laid out the plan of the work in his mind
    before his fall. He had near him in the Tower his learned Hariot,
    who was indefatigable in helping his master. Ben Jonson boasted that
    he had contributed to the work, and such books or knowledge as could
    not be obtained or consulted by a prisoner, were made available by
    scholars like Robert Burhill, by Hughes, Warner, or Hariot. Sir John
    Hoskyns, a great stylist in his day, would advise with regard to
    construction, and from many other quarters aid of various sorts was
    obtained. But, withal, the work is purely Raleigh’s. No student of his
    fine, flowing, majestic style will admit that any other pen but his
    can have produced it. The vast learning employed in it is now, for the
    most part, obsolete, but the human asides where Raleigh’s personality
    reveals itself, the little bits of incidental autobiography, the witty,
    apt illustrations, will prevent the work itself from dying. To judge
    from a remark in the preface, the author intended at a later stage
    to concentrate his history with that mainly of his own country, and
    it would seem that the portion of the book published was to a great
    extent introductory. Great as were his powers and self-confidence, it
    must have been obvious to him that it would have been impossible for a
    man of his age (he was in his sixtieth year when he began the work) to
    complete a history of the whole world on the same scale, the first six
    books published reaching from the beginning of the world to the end of
    the second Macedonian war. In any case,” adds Mr Hume, “the book will
    ever remain a noble fragment of a design, which could only have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> been
    conceived by a master-mind.” And who, recalling those mighty lines on
    death with which Raleigh bids farewell to his great work, but will
    agree with the above admirable criticism of the work?</p>

  <p>“O Eloquent, just and mighty Death! whom none could advise thou hast
    persuaded: what now none hath dared thou hast done; and whom the world
    hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised: thou
    hast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride,
    cruelty, ambition of man, and covered it over with these two narrow
    words: ‘Hic Jacet.’” How noble, too, are the introductory lines to Ben
    Jonson, wherein he commends the serious study of history:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“... that nor the good might be defrauded, nor the great so cured;</div>
        <div class="i0">But both might know their ways are understood,</div>
        <div class="i0">And the reward and punishment assured.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>No wonder that James disapproved of such sentiments and said of the
    “History,” “it is too saucy in censuring the acts of princes.”</p>

  <p>To Raleigh, more than to any other of the great Elizabethan heroes,
    does England owe her mighty earth-embracing dominion. Sir Walter
    never ceased to urge the expansion of the empire, nor wearied in his
    efforts to make the English fleet the foremost in all the seas, not
    only as a check to Spain, but in order that the colonial possessions
    of the kingdom might be increased; and he, more than any of our great
    soldier-statesmen deserved those noble lines of Milton: “Those who of
    thy free Grace didst build up this Brittanick Empire to a glorious and
    enviable height, with all her daughter islands about her, stay us in
    this felicitie.”</p>

  <p>In 1616 Raleigh was allowed to leave the fortress, but, as I have said
    before, in order to obtain his liberty he had been obliged to bribe
    George Villiers and his brother, who had roused James’s cupidity by
    persuading him that if Raleigh were allowed to lead a fresh expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
    to the West Indies, he might return with a great treasure of which
    James would take the lion’s share. A warrant, dated the 19th of March
    of this year, was drawn up, giving Raleigh permission to go abroad in
    order that he might make the necessary arrangements for his voyage.
    The twelve years of imprisonment had sadly marred and aged the gallant
    knight, but his spirit was as bold and courageous as ever, and he
    employed the first days of his liberty in revisiting his old London
    haunts; many changes must have struck him in the city. In Visscher’s
    panoramic view of London, taken from Southwark nearly opposite to St
    Paul’s, a very clear general impression may be gained of the appearance
    of the English capital in that year of sixteen hundred and sixteen,
    the year when Shakespeare was dying at Stratford-on-Avon, when Raleigh
    was on his way to his last journey across the Atlantic, and when
    Francis Bacon was writing his famous essays in Gray’s Inn. Those
    quaint, circular, Martello-like buildings in the foreground are the
    Globe and Swan theatres, with the Bear Garden close by; but the former
    theatre, in Visscher’s view, is not the one so intimately connected
    with Shakespeare, for that was burned down in 1613, and the building
    represented here is the new one erected upon its site. Opposite to the
    Swan Theatre, on the Surrey side of the river, are Paris Garden Stairs,
    where was a much frequented ferry, Blackfriars Bridge now spanning
    the river where this ferry once used to ply. There was also a theatre
    at Blackfriars, and Shakespeare and his players must often have used
    the ferry on their way from the Globe Theatre across the river from
    Blackfriars, where the poet lived. In front is old St Paul’s, towering
    over all the surrounding buildings and dwarfing the highest; scores of
    spires and towers break the skyline as the eye follows the panorama
    towards the west, where stands the former old London Bridge, covered
    along its sides with picturesque houses. So large and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> massive are
    the great blocks of gabled buildings that span the bridge, that it
    presents the appearance of a little town crossing the river, such as
    is the Ponte Vecchio at Florence in little. The gates at its ends are
    covered with men’s heads, stuck all over their roofs like pins upon a
    pincushion. More steeples and towers crown the opposite bank, and as
    the eye travels farther eastward it is arrested by the Tower, with its
    encircling wall, and its river wharf all covered with cannon. The river
    is alive with vessels of every shape and size, State barges and little
    pinnaces, great galleons and small craft, appear in all directions,
    some with, some without sails. Beyond, the distant hills of Middlesex
    and Essex are dotted with villages and hamlets, whilst on the heights
    of Highgate cluster a group of windmills. It is a wonderful panorama
    that the old Dutch artist has handed down to us. Looking at it we see
    the same scene, the same picture of time-honoured churches and palaces,
    the noblest river in the world flowing beneath them, and bearing on
    its shining surface all the pleasure, commerce, industry, and travail
    of old London, that Shakespeare did, when, standing near his theatre
    at Bankside, he gazed upon that shifting scene. All is changed now,
    except the Tower. The great Gothic cathedral of St Paul’s and most of
    its surrounding churches, whose towers and spires helped to make old
    London an object of beauty, perished in the great fire which swept
    over the city fifty years after Visscher drew his panorama. Old London
    Bridge escaped the fire, and indeed remained until 1834, although the
    houses clustering over it had been removed at the close of the reign
    of George <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and the only prominent building in the panorama which
    Shakespeare or Raleigh would now be able to recognise, could they look
    across the rivers Styx and Thames, would be the great White Tower with
    its surrounding lesser towers and battlements. All the rest, like “the
    baseless fabric of a vision,” has passed away for ever.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

  <p>But to return to Sir Walter Raleigh. He invested all that remained of
    his own and his wife’s fortunes in furnishing the expedition to Guiana,
    which proved so disastrous, on which he now embarked. On his return, a
    ruined man and a prisoner, he expressed his amazement at having thus
    in one desperate bid placed his life and all that he possessed in
    that unlucky venture. But before Raleigh had left England, Gondomar,
    the Spanish Ambassador, had told his master, the King of Spain, that
    Raleigh was a pre-doomed man. For James had not only revealed every
    detail relating to the Guiana expedition to Gondomar, but on condition
    that if any subject or property belonging to Spain were touched he had
    promised to hand over Raleigh to the Spanish Government in order that
    he might be hanged at Seville. To assure Gondomar of his good faith,
    James actually showed the ambassador a private letter written him by
    Raleigh, in which the exact number of his ships, men, and the place
    where the great silver mine was said to be located on the Orinoco, were
    all set forth. As the Spaniards claimed the whole of Guiana, it was
    evident that if Raleigh landed there he must infringe upon the Spanish
    possessions, and thus place himself, according to James’s promise to
    Gondomar, in the power of his enemies.</p>

  <p>The expedition sailed from England at the end of March 1617, from
    Plymouth, and consisted of fourteen ships and nine hundred men. But
    its story was one of continued disaster, and on the 21st of June 1618,
    writing to his friend Lord Carew, Raleigh gives a detailed account of
    all his misfortunes. In the postscript he adds: “I beg you will excuse
    me to my Lords for not writing to them, because want of sleep for fear
    of being surprised in my cabin at night” (even on his own ship he
    was a prisoner, the crew having mutinied) “has almost deprived me of
    sight, and some return of the pleurisy which I had in the Tower has so
    weakened my hand that I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> hold the pen.” Sir Walter’s eldest son
    was killed gallantly fighting in Guiana.</p>

  <p>Then followed a miserable time, and on his road to London the hope of
    life at times impelled him to attempt escape, but he was doomed to
    drink the bitter cup of his King’s ingratitude to the dregs. On the
    10th of August he again entered the Tower where so much of his life had
    been spent, and which was now to be his last abode on earth.</p>

  <p>The next day the Council of State met to decide upon Sir Walter’s
    fate, and incredible as it seems, it was actually debated whether
    Raleigh should be handed over to the tender mercies of the Spaniards or
    executed in London. Surely if what passed on this earth could have been
    known to Elizabeth, she would have burst her tomb at Westminster to
    protest against this abomination, this unspeakable shame and disgrace
    to the name of England.</p>

  <p>James was now all impatience to get rid of Raleigh as quickly as
    possible; he trembled at the threats of Gondomar, and had the sapient
    monarch not given his word that Raleigh should die? The great
    difficulty before the Council, however, was to find a pretext for
    condemning Raleigh to death. Bacon and his colleagues racked their wise
    brains to invent a cause by which he could be found guilty of high
    treason. At length the Lord Chief-Justice, Montagu, with a committee
    of the Council decided that the King should issue a warrant for the
    re-affirmation of the death sentence given at Winchester in 1603, by
    which it might be made valid and carried out. Sir Walter pleaded that
    the King’s commission appointing him head of the Guiana expedition
    with powers of life and death, invalidated the former sentence and its
    punishment, both in the eyes of justice and of reason. But Sir Walter
    was overruled. On the 24th of October the warrant for the execution was
    signed and sealed by the King, and four days later Sir Walter was taken
    from the Tower to the King’s Bench. He <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>was then suffering from ague,
    and having been roused from his sleep very early had not had time to
    have his now snow-white hair dressed with his usual care. One of his
    servants noticed this as he was being taken away, and telling him of
    it, Raleigh answered, smiling, “Let them kem (comb) it that have it,”
    then he added, “Peter, dost thou know of any plaister to set a man’s
    head on again when it is cut off?”</p>

  </div>

  <p>The end being now so certain and so near, the bright courage of the man
    returned; there was no shrinking with the closing scene so close at
    hand. He was not brought back to the Tower after his condemnation, and
    he passed his last night upon earth in the Gate House at Westminster,
    close to which the scaffold stood in Old Palace Yard. He had a last
    parting that evening with his devoted wife, his “dear Bess,” but
    neither dared to speak of their only remaining son—that would have
    been too bitter a pang for them to bear. Sir Walter’s last words to
    his wife were full of hope and courage: “It is well, dear Bess,” he
    said, referring to Lady Raleigh having been promised his body next
    day, the only mercy allowed her by the Council, “that thou mayest
    dispose of that dead which thou hadst not always the disposing of when
    alive.” Then she left him. During the long hours of that last night, he
    composed those beautiful lines which will last as long as the language
    in which they are written:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Even such is time! who takes in trust</div>
        <div class="i1">Our youth, our joys, and all we have,</div>
        <div class="i1">And pays us but with earth and dust:</div>
        <div class="i1">Who in the dark and silent grave,</div>
        <div class="i1">When we have wandered all our ways,</div>
        <div class="i1">Shuts up the story of our days.</div>
        <div class="i1">But from that earth, that grave, that dust,</div>
        <div class="i1">The Lord shall raise me up I trust.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Raleigh wrote these lines in a Bible which he had brought with him from
    the Tower.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

  <p>Carlyle has summed up Raleigh’s life and death in the following
    pregnant lines, in his “Historical Sketches”:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“On the morning of the 29th of October 1618 in Palace Yard, a cold
      morning, equivalent to our 8th of November, behold Sir Walter
      Raleigh, a tall gray-headed man of sixty-five gone. He has been in
      far countries, seen the El Dorado, penetrated into the fabulous
      dragon-realms of the West, hanged Spaniards in Ireland, rifled
      Spaniards in Orinoco—for forty years in quest a most busy man;
      has appeared in many characters; this is his last appearance on
      any stage. Probably as brave a soul as lives in England;—he has
      come here to die by the headman’s axe. What crime? Alas, he has
      been unfortunate: become an eyesore to the Spanish, and did not
      discover El Dorado mine. Since Winchester, when John Gibb came
      galloping (with a reprieve), he has been lain thirteen years in
      the Tower; the travails of that strong heart have been many. Poor
      Raleigh, toiling, travelling always: in Court drawing-rooms, on the
      hot shore of Guiana, with gold and promotions in his fancy, with
      suicide, death, and despair in clear sight of him; toiling till his
      brain is broken (his own expression) and his heart is broken: here
      stands he at last; after many travails it has come to this with him.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Sir Walter Raleigh died a martyr to the cause of a Greater Britain; his
    life thrown as a sop to the Spanish Cerberus by the most debased and
    ignoble of our kings. Raleigh’s faults were undoubtedly many, but his
    great qualities, his superb courage, his devotion to his country, his
    faith in the future greatness of England, were infinitely greater, and
    outweighed a thousand times all his failings. The onus of the guilt of
    his death—a judicial murder if ever there was one—must be borne by the
    base councillors who truckled to the King, and by the King himself who,
    Judas-like, sold Raleigh to Spain.</p>

  <p>Some less interesting State prisoners occupied the Tower towards
    the close of the inglorious reign of James Stuart. Among these were
    Gervase, Lord Clifford, imprisoned for threatening the Lord Keeper
    in 1617. Clifford committed suicide in the Tower in the following
    year. About the same time, Sir Thomas Luke, one of the Secretaries of
    State, and his daughter, were imprisoned in the Tower on the charge
    of insulting Lady Exeter, whom they accused of incest and witchcraft,
    but, whether the charges were true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> or false, they were soon liberated.
    James’s court seems to have combined all the vices, for Lord and Lady
    Suffolk were also prisoners in the fortress about the same time,
    accused of bribery and corruption.</p>

  <p>To the Tower also were sent the two great lawyers—Lord Chancellor
    Bacon, and Sir Edward Coke—the former for having received bribes, the
    latter for the part he had taken in supporting the privileges of the
    House of Commons. Here, also, two noble lords, the Earl of Arundel
    and Lord Spencer, were in durance, owing to a quarrel between them in
    the House of Lords, when Arundel had insulted Spencer by telling him
    that at no distant time back his ancestors had been engaged in tending
    sheep, to which Lord Spencer responded: “When my ancestors were keeping
    sheep, yours were plotting treason.” The dispute seems scarcely of
    sufficient importance to have sent both disputants to the Tower.</p>

  <p>In 1622 the Earl of Oxford and Robert Philip, together with some
    members of Parliament, were sent to the fortress for objecting too
    publicly to the suggested marriage of the Prince of Wales, afterwards
    Charles I., with a Spanish princess; and the Earl of Bristol was also
    in the Tower for matters connected with the same projected alliance.
    It was not always safe to have an opinion of one’s own under James the
    First.</p>

  <p>The last State prisoner of mark to be sent to the Tower in James’s
    reign was Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, who had been found
    guilty of receiving bribes in his official capacity as Lord High
    Treasurer.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">CHARLES <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> AND THE COMMONWEALTH</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">With</span> the close of the reign of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the Tower ceased to be a royal
    residence—the Stuart kings, in fact, never passing more than a night
    or two in the old fortress prior to their coronation, after which they
    only visited it on very rare occasions. James himself only occupied the
    Tower-Palace on the eve of opening his first Parliament; and as the
    plague had broken out in the city at the time of Charles the First’s
    coronation, that king did not even stay the previous night in the
    building, nor does he appear ever to have visited the fortress during
    the whole of his stormy reign of four and twenty years.</p>

  <p>A very remarkable man occupied a prison in the Tower early in Charles’s
    reign. This was Sir John Eliot, “fiery Eliot” Carlyle calls him. He
    was first of that noble band of patriots who defied Charles’s tyranny,
    and had been sent to the Tower in the winter of 1624–25 for censuring
    Buckingham during Charles’s second Parliament, but he remained there
    only a short time. In the March of 1628, however, Eliot, with a
    batch of independent members of the House of Commons—amongst whom
    were Denzil Holles, Selden, Valentine, Coryton, and Heyman—was again
    imprisoned in the Tower. Eliot had boldly declared that the “King’s
    judges, Privy Council, Judges and learned Council had conspired to
    trample under their feet the liberties of the subjects of the realm,
    and the liberties of the House.” Denzil Holles and Valentine were the
    two members who had kept the Speaker in his chair by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>main force;
    the others were committed to prison for using language reflecting
    on the King and his Ministers. For the following three months these
    members of Parliament were kept in close confinement in the fortress,
    books and all writing materials being strictly kept from them. In
    May, Sir John Eliot was taken to Westminster, where an inquiry was
    held but no judgment given. After his return to the Tower, however,
    Eliot was allowed to write letters, and was also given “the liberty
    of the Tower,” and permitted to see a few friends. In the month of
    October Eliot and the others were taken to the chambers of the Lord
    Chief-Justice, and thence to the Marshalsea Prison, a change which he
    jokingly described as having “left their Palace in London for country
    quarters at Southwark.” Then they were tried, and Eliot, being judged
    the most culpable, was fined two thousand pounds, and ordered to be
    imprisoned in the Tower during the King’s pleasure. As for the fine,
    Eliot remarked that he “possessed two cloaks, two suits of clothes, two
    pairs of boots, and a few books, and if they could pick two thousand
    pounds out of that, much good might it do them.” The fearless member
    never quitted the Tower again, for a galloping consumption carried
    him off two years after he had written the above lines. There can be
    no doubt that this consumption was not a little owing to the harsh
    treatment he endured. In 1630 he wrote to his friend Knightley,
    alluding to rumours of his being released. “Have no confidence in such
    reports; sand was the best material on which they rested, and the many
    fancies of the multitude; unless they pointed at that kind of libertie,
    ‘libertie of mynde.’ But other libertie I know not, having so little
    interest in her masters that I expect no service from her.” His prison
    was frequently changed, and many restraints were put upon him, for,
    on the 26th of December, he writes to his old friend, the famous John
    Hampden, that his lodgings have been moved. “I am now,” he says, “where
    candle-light may be suffered, but scarce fire. None<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> but my servants,
    hardly my sonne, may have admittance to me; my friends I must desire
    for their own sake to forbear coming to the Tower.” Poor Eliot was
    dying fast in the year 1632, but his last letter to Hampden, dated the
    22nd of March, is full of his old brave spirit, and the gentle humour
    that distinguished this great and good man. The letter concludes thus:
    “Great is the authority of princes, but greater much is theirs who both
    command our persons and our will. What the success of their Government
    will be must be referred to Him that is master of their power.” The
    doctor had informed the authorities that any fresh air and exercise
    would help Eliot to live, but all the air they gave him was a “smoky
    room,” and all the exercise, a few steps on the platform of a wall.
    On the 27th of November Eliot died, “not without a suspicion of foul
    play,” wrote Ludlow some years afterwards.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_028">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Byward Tower</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Eliot’s staunch friends, Pym and Hampden, moved in the House for a
    committee “to examine after what manner Sir John Eliot came to his
    death, his usage in the Tower, and to view the rooms and place where he
    was imprisoned and where he died, and to report the same to the House,”
    a motion which shows how matters had changed for the better since the
    days of Elizabeth, none of whose Parliaments would have dared thus to
    question the treatment of State prisoners.</p>

  <p>The blame of his untimely death—for he was but forty-two—rests upon
    those who let him die by inches in his prison as much as if they had
    beheaded him on Tower Hill. John Eliot died a martyr in the cause of
    constitutional liberty as opposed to monarchical autocracy. Eliot’s son
    petitioned the King to be allowed to remove his father’s body to their
    old Cornish home at St Germains, but the vindictive and narrow-minded
    monarch, who would not even forgive Eliot after death had intervened,
    refused the prayer, writing at the foot of the petition, “Lett Sir John
    Eliot’s body be buried in the church of the parish where he died.” No
    stone marks the spot where he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> buried, and his dust mingles with
    that of the illustrious dead in St Peter’s Chapel in the Tower, but his
    name will be remembered as long as liberty is loved in his native land.</p>

  <p>We now come to a period of quite another sort.</p>

  <p>In Carlyle’s “Historical Sketches,” John Felton, the assassin of
    Buckingham, is thus described:—“Short, swart figure, of military
    taciturnity, of Rhadamanthian energy and gravity.... Passing along
    Tower Hill one of these August days (in 1628) Lieutenant Felton sees a
    sheath-knife on a stall there, value thirteen pence, of short, broad
    blade, sharp trowel point.” We know the use Felton made of that Tower
    Hill knife on his visit to Portsmouth, where Buckingham was then about
    to set sail for his second expedition to La Rochelle; how he stabbed
    the gay Duke to the heart, exclaiming, as he struck him: “God have
    mercy on thy soul!” how he was promptly arrested, brought to London and
    imprisoned in the Tower.</p>

  <p>The reason, or reasons, for Felton killing Buckingham have never been
    made clear. He appears to have been a soured religious fanatic, but
    the crime was doubtless owing to some fancied injustice regarding his
    promotion in the army; and it has been thought that it was merely an
    act of private vengeance, rather than one of political significance.
    But after his arrest a paper was found fastened in Felton’s hat,
    with the following writing upon it:—“That man is cowardly, base,
    and deserveth not the name of a gentleman or soldier, that is not
    willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of his God, King, and his
    countrie. Lett no man commend me for doing of it, but rather discommend
    themselves as the cause of it, for if God hath not taken away our
    hearts for our sins, he would not have gone so long unpunished.—Jno.
    Felton.” A sentiment which goes to show that Felton assassinated
    Buckingham with the fanatical idea of benefiting his country.</p>

  <p>So hated was Buckingham by the people, that Felton passed into the
    Tower amid blessings and prayers. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> was placed in the prison lately
    occupied by Sir John Eliot in the Bloody Tower, and before his death
    made two requests—one, that he might be permitted to take the Holy
    Communion, and the other that he might be executed with a halter round
    his neck, ashes on his head, and sackcloth round his loins. On being
    threatened with the rack in order to induce him to give the names of
    his accomplices, Felton said to Lord Dorset that, in the first place,
    he would not believe that it was the King’s wish that he should be
    tortured, it being illegal; and, secondly, that if he were racked, he
    would name Dorset, and none but him—a capital answer. When he was asked
    why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, he answered: “I
    am sorry both that I have shed the blood of a man who is the image
    of God, and taken away the life of so near a subject of the King.”
    As a last favour, he begged that his right hand might be struck off
    before he was hanged. He suffered at Tyburn, and his body was gibbeted
    in chains at Portsmouth. “His dead body,” writes Evelyn, “is carried
    down to Portsmouth, hangs high there. I hear it creak in the wind.” An
    eye-witness describes Felton as showing much courage and calm during
    his trial and at his death, and Philip, Earl of Exeter, who attended
    the execution, declared that he had never seen such valour and piety,
    “more temperately mixed,” as in Felton’s demeanour. This is surely one
    of the strangest mysteries in our history.</p>

  <p>Prisoners still continued to come to the Tower, and in 1631, Mervin,
    Lord Audley, was executed on Tower Hill for a crime not of a political
    nature. Six years later a very distinguished ecclesiastic, John
    Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, was imprisoned for four years within the
    Tower walls. Williams, who was a Privy Councillor, had repeated some
    remarks made by the King, in which His Majesty had advocated greater
    leniency in the treatment of the Puritans, and was accused of revealing
    Charles’s private conversation, and being an enemy of Laud’s was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> very
    hardly dealt with in consequence. He was deposed from his bishopric,
    fined £10,000, and imprisoned in the Tower, where he caused some
    surprise, if not scandal, by not attending the church services in the
    fortress. However, after his release, Williams was reconciled to the
    King, and in 1641 became Archbishop of York. He had been successively
    Dean of Salisbury and Dean of Westminster, and had succeeded Bacon as
    Lord Chancellor in 1621, just before he had been appointed to the See
    of Lincoln. Williams certainly belonged to the Church Militant, and
    during the Civil War defended Conway Castle most gallantly for the
    royal cause. At the end of December 1641, he was back again in the
    Tower, with ten other Bishops who had protested that, owing to their
    being kept out of the House of Lords by the violence of the mob, all
    Acts passed during their absence were illegal. The Peers arrested the
    protesting Bishops on a charge of high treason; and on a very cold
    and snowy December night they were all sent to the Tower, where they
    remained until the May of 1642.</p>

  <p>Lord Loudon, who had been sent by the Scottish Covenanters to Charles,
    had a narrow escape of leaving his head on Tower Hill in 1639.
    According to Clarendon, a letter was discovered of a treasonable
    nature, signed by Loudon, addressed to Louis XIII. of France, and
    Charles ordered Sir William Balfour, by virtue of a warrant signed
    by the royal hand, to have the Scottish lord executed the following
    morning. In this terrible dilemma Loudon bethought him of his friend,
    the Marquis of Hamilton, and gave the Lieutenant a message for that
    nobleman. Now it was one of the privileges of the Lieutenant of the
    Tower that he could at any time, or in any place, claim an audience
    with the sovereign. Hamilton persuaded Balfour to go with him to
    Charles, but on arriving at Whitehall, they found that the King had
    already retired for the night. Balfour, however, taking advantage
    of his privilege, entered the room with Hamilton, and together they
    besought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> Charles to re-consider his decision, pointing out to him that
    Loudon was protected by his quality as Ambassador from the Scotch. The
    King, as was his wont, was obdurate. “No,” he said; “the warrant must
    be obeyed.” At length the Marquis, having begged in vain, left the
    chamber, saying, “Well, then, if your Majesty be so determined, I’ll
    go and get ready to ride post for Scotland to-morrow morning, for I
    am sure before night the whole city will be in an uproar, and they’ll
    come and pull your Majesty out of your palace. I’ll get as far as I
    can, and declare to my countrymen that I had no hand in it.” On hearing
    this, Charles called for the warrant and destroyed it. Loudon was soon
    afterwards released (Oldnixon’s “History of the Stuarts”).</p>

  <p>Now comes the story of the last days of one of Charles’s most noted
    counsellors—last days that, as in the case of many before him, were
    passed within the grim precincts of the Tower, and were the prelude
    to execution. On the 11th of November 1640, the Earl of Strafford was
    at Whitehall laying before Charles a scheme for accusing the heads of
    the parliamentary party of holding a treasonable correspondence with
    the Scotch army, then encamped in the North of England. Whilst he was
    with the King the news reached him that Pym at that very moment was
    impeaching him in the House of Commons on the charge of high treason.
    Strafford at once made his way to the House, but was not allowed to
    speak, and shortly afterwards heard his committal made out for the
    Tower. At the same time Archbishop Laud was arrested at Lambeth Palace,
    and carried off to the great State prison. “As I went to my barge,”
    Laud writes in his diary, “hundreds of my poor neighbours stood there
    and prayed for my safety and return to my home.” But neither he nor
    Strafford were ever to return to their homes. Perhaps Strafford’s life
    might have been saved had it not been for the King’s action, for when
    it became known that Charles had plotted with the hope of inducing
    the Scottish army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> to march on London, seize the Tower and liberate
    Strafford, the great Earl was practically doomed. The city rose as one
    man, a huge mob surging round the Houses of Parliament and the Palace
    of Whitehall, shouting “Justice.”</p>

  <p>For fifteen days Strafford faced his accusers and judges at Westminster
    Hall, his defence being a splendid piece of oratory. He proved that on
    the ground of high treason his judgment would not count, and his judges
    were compelled to introduce an Act of Attainder in order to convict
    him; but for the next six months he was kept in the Tower, uncertain
    as to his ultimate fate until the 12th of May 1641, when the Bill of
    Attainder was passed by the Lords.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>Charles had sworn to Strafford that not a single hair of his head
    should be injured; but on the Earl writing to him and offering his life
    as the only means of healing the troubles of the country, the King
    yielded, and deserting his minister, gave his assent to the execution,
    and signed the warrant.</p>

  <p>On the following morning Strafford was led out to die. There is no more
    dramatic episode in the great struggle between Charles and his people
    than that when Strafford, amidst his guards, passed beneath the gateway
    of the Bloody Tower, where, from an upper window, his old friend,
    Archbishop Laud, gave him his blessing. The Archbishop, overcome, sank
    back fainting into the arms of his attendants. “I hope,” he is reported
    to have said, “by God’s assistance and through mine own innocency that
    when I come to my own execution, I shall shew the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>world how much more
    sensible I am to my Lord Strafford’s loss than I am to my own.”</p>

  <p>Knowing how bitterly Strafford was hated by the people, the Lieutenant
    of the Tower invited him to drive to Tower Hill in his coach, fearing
    he might be torn to pieces if he went on foot. Strafford, however,
    declined the offer, saying, “No, Mr Lieutenant, I dare look death
    in the face, and I trust the people too.” With the Earl were the
    Archbishop of Armagh (Ussher), Lord Cleveland, and his brother, Sir
    George Wentworth. On reaching the scaffold Strafford made a short
    speech, followed by a long prayer, and giving his final messages for
    his wife and children to his brother, said: “One stroke more will make
    my wife husbandless, my dear children fatherless, my poor servants
    masterless, and will separate me from my dear brother and all my
    friends; but let God be to you and to them all in all.” He then removed
    his doublet, and said, “I thank God that I am no more afraid of death,
    but as cheerfully put off my doublet at this time as ever I did when I
    went to bed.” Then placing a white cap upon his head, and thrusting his
    long hair beneath it, he knelt down at the block, the Archbishop also
    kneeling on one side and a clergyman upon the other, the Archbishop
    clasping Strafford’s hands in both his own. After they had left him
    Strafford gave the sign for the executioner to strike by thrusting out
    both his hands, and at one blow, “the wisest head in England,” as John
    Evelyn, who was present, says, “was severed from his body.” On that
    night London blazed with bonfires, and the people rejoiced as if in
    celebration of some great victory.</p>

  <p>The great Earl’s mistake was in serving and trusting such a king as
    Charles. Later on it transpired that Charles had a plan of removing
    Strafford from the Tower by throwing a hundred men into the fortress,
    thus relieving the Earl, and keeping possession of the Tower as a check
    upon the city. In pursuance of this plan, on the 2nd May 1641, Captain
    Billingsby with a force of one hundred <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>men presented himself at the
    gates of the Tower, but Sir William Balfour refused to admit them, and
    the King’s scheme for taking the fortress fell to the ground.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The first beginnings of a Tower regiment, according to Mr J. H. Round,
    was the appointment of two hundred men as Tower Guards in 1640. In
    November of the same year Charles promised to remove this garrison,
    but he did not do so until the city offered to lend him £25,000, on
    the condition that these troops should be taken away, as well as the
    ordnance from the White Tower, which was a perpetual menace to the
    safety of the city. Aersen, the Dutch Ambassador, writing to his
    Government about this time, says, “le dessein semble aller sur le
    tour.” Still the King would not withdraw the soldiers or the cannon,
    and then the House of Lords expostulated with him, but Charles excused
    his breach of faith by saying that his object was merely to insure the
    safety of the stores and ammunition in the fortress.</p>

  <p>After his plot to seize the Tower had been made public, the train bands
    belonging to the Tower Hamlets occupied and garrisoned the fortress.
    These train bands, as well as those of Southwark and Westminster, were
    distinct from the city train bands. On the 3rd of January 1642, the
    King made another attempt to garrison the Tower with his own troops,
    which also proved a failure. On this occasion Sir John Byron entered
    the fortress with a detachment of gunners and disarmed the men of
    the Tower Hamlets, but the city train bands came to the rescue, and
    Byron, with his gunners, had to beat a retreat. When, in 1642, the
    Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir John Conyers, resigned his charge, the
    Parliament conferred the Lieutenancy upon the Lord Mayor of London.
    Later, in 1647, when the city had taken the side of the Parliament
    against the King, Fairfax was appointed Constable; the Constables had
    succeeded each other according to the chances which brought the King
    or the Parliament to the top, thus Lord Cottrington had been replaced
    by Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> William Balfour, and he in his turn had given room to Sir
    Thomas Lumsford, a “soldier of fortune,” writes Ludlow of him in his
    “Memoirs,” “fit for any wicked design.” Lumsford, so uncomplimentarily
    referred to by Ludlow, was supposed to be willing to act according to
    the King’s good pleasure, and succeeded in making himself so unpopular
    with the Londoners, that they petitioned the House of Lords to beg the
    King to place the custody of the Tower in other hands, the Lord Mayor
    saying he could not undertake to prevent the apprentices from rising
    were Lumsford allowed to remain in office; so Charles unwillingly gave
    the keys of the fortress to the care of Sir John Byron. Byron, in his
    turn, was succeeded by Sir John Conyers, who had distinguished himself
    in the Scottish wars and had been Governor of Berwick; and after
    Conyers followed Lord Mayor Pennington,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “in order,” as Clarendon
    writes, “that the citizens might see that they were trusted to hold
    their own reins and had a jurisdiction committed to them which had
    always checked their own.” From 1643 to 1647 the Tower remained in
    the hands of the Parliament. In the latter year the army obtained the
    mastery, and Sir Thomas Fairfax, the Commander-in-Chief, became its
    Constable, under him being Colonel Tichbourne as Lieutenant of the
    fortress. Shortly after the King’s execution, however, Fairfax resigned
    his post of Constable, none other than Cromwell, himself, stepping into
    the vacant place.</p>

  <p>But we must return to Archbishop Laud, who for four years was a
    prisoner in the Bloody Tower in the prison chamber over the gateway of
    that gloomy building.</p>

  <p>In his diary, the Archbishop has left a minute account of a domiciliary
    visit paid him by William Prynne in 1643. The Archbishop’s trial
    being determined on by the House <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>of Lords, Prynne was commissioned
    by the Peers to obtain Laud’s private papers. “Mr Prynne,” writes
    the Archbishop, “came into the Tower with other searchers as soon
    as the gates were open. Other men went to other prisoners; he made
    haste to my lodging, commanded the warder to open my doors, left two
    musketeer centinels below, that no man might go in or out, and one
    at the stairhead. With three others, which had their muskets already
    cocked, he came into my chamber, and found me in bed, as my servants
    were in theirs. I presently thought on my blessed Saviour when Judas
    led in the swords and staves about him.”—This surely is rather a bold
    comparison for an Archbishop to make?—“Mr Prynne, seeing me safe in
    bed, falls first to my pockets to rifle them; and by that time my
    two servants came running in half ready. I demanded the sight of his
    warrant; he shewed it to me, and therein was expressed that he should
    search my pockets. The warrant came from the close committee, and the
    hands that were to it were these: E. Manchester, W. Saye and Seale,
    Wharton, H. Vane, Gilbert Gerard, and John Pym. Did they remember when
    they gave their warrant how odious it was to Parliament, and some of
    themselves, to have the pockets of men searched? When my pockets had
    been sufficiently ransacked, I rose and got my clothes about me, and
    so, half ready, with my gown about my shoulders, he held me in the
    search till half-past nine of the clock in the morning. He took from me
    twenty and one bundles of papers which I had prepared for my defence;
    two Letters which came to me from his gracious Majesty, about Chartham
    and my other benefices; the Scottish service books or diary, containing
    all the occurrences of my life, and my book of private devotions, both
    which last were written through with my own hand. Nor could I get him
    to leave this last, but he must needs see what passed between God
    and me, a thing, I think, scarce offered to any Christian. The last
    place that he rifled was my trunk, which stood by my bedside. In that
    he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> found nothing, but about forty pounds in money, for my necessary
    expenses, which he meddled not with, and a bundle of some gloves. This
    bundle he was so careful to open, so that he caused each glove to be
    looked into. Upon this I tendered him one pair of gloves, which he
    refusing, I told him he might take them, and fear no bribe, for he had
    already done me all the mischief he could, and I asked no favour of
    him, so he thanked me, took the gloves, bound up my papers, left two
    centinels at my door, and went his way.”—(From “Troubles and Trials of
    Archbishop Laud.”)</p>

  <p>Prynne, whose ears Laud had been the means of cutting off some
    half-dozen years before, must have enjoyed this visit to his old foe.
    On the 10th of March 1643, the Archbishop was brought to his trial in
    Westminster Hall, but amongst all the charges brought against him none
    could be considered as proving him guilty of high treason. Serjeant
    Wild was obliged to admit this, but said that when all the Archbishop’s
    transgressions of the law were put together they made “many grand
    treasons.” To this Laud’s counsel made answer, “I crave you mercy, good
    Mr Serjeant, I never understood before this that two hundred couple of
    black rabbits made a black horse.”—(In Archbishop Tennison’s MSS. in
    Lambeth Library. Quoted by Bayley.)</p>

  <p>Laud’s trial lasted for twenty days, the chief accusation brought
    against him being that he had “attempted to subvert religion and the
    fundamental laws of the realm.” The outcome of the trial was that Laud
    was beheaded on Tower Hill on 10th of January 1644. Laud was a strange
    compound of bigotry and intolerance, of courage and of devotion to what
    he considered to be the true Church, and of which he seemed to regard
    himself as a kind of Anglican Pope. His life and character are enigmas
    to those who study them, and his death became him far better than his
    life had done.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

  <p>Carlyle, in a delightful passage in his posthumously published
    “Historical Studies,” writes: “Future ages, if they do not, as is
    likelier, totally forget ‘W. Cant,’ will range him under the category
    of Incredibilities. Not again in the dead strata which lie under men’s
    feet, will such a fossil be dug up. This wonderful wonder of wonders,
    were it not even this, a zealous Chief Priest, at once persecutor and
    martyr, who has no discernible religion of his own?” “No one,” said
    Laud, when told of the day on which he was to die, “no one can be
    more ready to send me out of life than I am to go.” Indeed, no one
    could have left life in a calmer or more tranquil manner than did
    the Archbishop. It must be a great support to have a sublime opinion
    of oneself, and if ever man had a sublime opinion of himself it was
    Laud. The comparison he made in his diary, and which I have already
    quoted, between his Saviour and himself—between Prynne-Judas and
    Laud-Christ—proves the ineffable self-conceit of the prelate.</p>

  <p>The fact that he himself was notoriously indifferent, if not callous,
    to the sufferings of others, has destroyed all the sympathy that might
    have been felt for this strange character in his fall and tribulations.
    For a mere difference of opinion Laud would order ears to be lopped
    off, noses slit, and brows and cheeks to be branded with red-hot iron.
    His best and most enduring monument is the addition he made to St
    John’s College at Oxford, of which he was at one time the president,
    and in whose chapel his remains were re-interred, after resting for
    a time in the Church of All Hallows, Barking, and in the library of
    which his spectre is said to be seen occasionally gliding on moonlight
    nights, between the old bookshelves.</p>

  <p>After the month of August 1642, when Charles had unfurled his standard
    at Nottingham, the Tower, although nominally still in the King’s
    possession, was in reality held by the Parliament; and its prisoners
    were those who were opposed to the representatives of the people.
    Among these was Sir Ralph Hopton, who had protested against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> a violent
    address made by the Parliament against Charles, Sir Ralph having
    declared that his fellow-members “seemed to ground an opinion of the
    King’s apostacy upon less evidence than would serve to hang a fellow
    for stealing a horse.” This remark brought him to the Tower, where
    he was soon joined by another member of Parliament, Trelawney (or
    Trelauney), who had informed the House of Commons that they could not
    legally appoint a guard of troops for themselves without the King’s
    assent, under pain of high treason (Clarendon).</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph, afterwards Lord Hopton of Stratton, distinguished himself
    later in the war in the West of England, where he had much success,
    and with the help of Sir Beville Grenville, gained a signal victory
    over the Parliamentarians at Stamford Hill, near Stratton, in Cornwall.
    Fairfax, however, ultimately proved too strong for him, and finally
    Hopton left England, dying at Bruges in 1652.</p>

  <p>Besides these, Sir Thomas Bedingfield and Sir James Gardner were
    committed to the Tower by the House of Lords, “for refusing to be of
    the counsel of the Attorney-General,” whilst the Earl of Bristol and
    Judge Mallet followed them to the fortress, “merely for having seen
    the Kentish petition.” This petition was drawn up by the principal
    inhabitants of that county, praying, “that the militia might not
    otherwise be exercised in that county than the known law permitted, and
    that the Book of Common Prayer, established by law, might be observed.”
    Lord Bristol soon obtained his liberty, but Mallet was kept a prisoner
    for two years on the charge of being “a fomentor and protector of
    malignant factions against the Parliament” (Clarendon).</p>

  <p>In the same year, Sir Richard Gurney, Lord Mayor of London, was sent
    to the Tower on the charge of having caused the King’s proclamation
    against the militia, and for suppressing petitions to Parliament, to be
    published in the city. Sir Richard was dismissed from his mayoralty,
    and imprisoned during the pleasure of the House. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> Lord Mayor,
    loyal to the cause of the King, Sir Abraham Reynoldson, was, six years
    later, also a prisoner in the Tower; but his incarceration lasted only
    two months, whilst Gurney, it seems, remained for several years in the
    fortress. The Parliament meted out heavy punishment for “opinions,”
    Lord Montagu of Boughton, the Earl of Berkshire, and some Norfolk
    squires, being likewise sent to the Tower on a charge of favouring the
    King’s side, and of being hostile to the Parliament. In 1643 Justice
    Berkeley was imprisoned by order of the Lords on a charge of high
    treason, and also a Mr Montagu, a “messenger” from the French Court to
    the King.</p>

  <p>At this time whole batches of Cavaliers began to be frequently brought
    to the Tower. Of these, Sir William Moreton, who was captured at the
    fall of Sudeley Castle, of which he was the governor, remained a
    prisoner until the Restoration, when he was made a judge. Another was
    Daniel O’Neale, who had greatly distinguished himself on the royal
    side in the Scottish war, and later in England. He was committed to
    the Tower on the invariable charge of high treason, but, like Lord
    Nithsdale, about half-a-century later, he managed to break his prison
    in female attire, and succeeded in reaching Holland, whence he returned
    to serve under Rupert as a lieutenant-colonel in the Prince’s cavalry.
    According to Clarendon, O’Neale became a celebrated adept in court
    intrigue in the time of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></p>

  <p>In this year (1643), Sir John Conyers was in command of the fortress,
    having received the charge from the Parliament in the hope that he
    would be gained over to that side. On being asked to take the command
    of the Parliamentary army, Conyers, however, declined, his refusal
    causing so much annoyance to the leaders of that party that he thought
    it more prudent to resign his charge of the Tower, being, as Clarendon
    puts it, too conscientious, “to keep His Majesty’s only fort which he
    could not apply to his services.” His place, as has already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> been said,
    was given to Sir Isaac Pennington, Lord Mayor of London.</p>

  <p>In 1644, Sir John Hotham, and his son, Captain Hotham, who had
    been imprisoned in the Tower in the preceding summer on the charge
    of intending to surrender the town of Hull to the King, were both
    beheaded on Tower Hill. Hotham may be described as the Bazaine of the
    Parliament. The town of Hull was the greatest magazine of arms and
    ammunition in England. Charles had in vain summoned Hotham, who was the
    Governor for the Parliament, to surrender the town, and on his refusal
    had declared him a traitor. There is little doubt that both Hotham and
    his son were Royalists at heart, and both were convicted of having
    entered into a correspondence with the King’s party in order to come to
    terms for the surrender of the town and arsenal to the Royalist forces.</p>

  <p>Another governor—Sir Alexander Carew, who held Plymouth for the
    Parliament—was beheaded in the same month as the Hothams for a like
    “intention.” Carew is said to have been decapitated with the same axe
    with which Strafford was killed, and it was reported that at the time
    of Strafford’s trial, Carew had said that sooner than not vote for
    the Earl’s death, he would be ready to be the next man to suffer on
    the same scaffold, and with the same axe: a wish which was literally
    fulfilled. (Dugdale’s “Short View of the Late Troubles.”)</p>

  <p>By one of those strange vagaries of fortune which are the
    characteristic of the history of this period, and in which the Tower
    played its accustomed part of imprisonment, George Monk, the future
    Duke of Albemarle, and one of the makers of our history, was imprisoned
    in the Tower for three years after his capture by Fairfax at the siege
    of Nantwich. He was a colonel at the time, and only regained his
    freedom by consenting to take the command of the Parliamentary forces
    sent to Ireland (Ludlow’s Memoirs).</p>

  <p>Two of Monk’s fellow-prisoners, Lord Macquire and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> Colonel MacMahon,
    who had both been fighting on the Royalist side in Ireland, made a
    desperate attempt to escape from the Tower in this same year (1644).
    They succeeded in sawing through their prison door and lowered
    themselves by a rope, which they had been enabled to find through
    directions written on a slip of paper that had been placed in a loaf
    of bread, sent to them by some of their friends. They got down into
    the moat, across which they swam, but were taken on the other side and
    hanged at Tyburn in February 1645, although Macquire pleaded that, as
    an Irish peer, he had the right of dying by the axe and not by the
    halter. For allowing the escape of these officers from their prison
    chamber the Lieutenant of the Tower was fined heavily.</p>

  <p>That splendid cavalier, “Old Loyalty,” as he was proudly called,
    John Paulett, Marquis of Worcester, who had defended Baring House so
    long and so well, came a prisoner into the Tower in this same year,
    accompanied by Sir Robert Peake, who had aided him in the defence of
    his home, and who had also been taken prisoner after the storming of
    the place. They were followed by Sir John Strangways, who had been
    taken at the siege of Cardiff. In 1647 Sir John Maynard, Serjeant
    Glynn, the Recorder of London, and the Lord Mayor, Sir John Gayre,
    with some of his aldermen and sheriffs, were in the Tower, and amongst
    the Royalists who were brought to the fortress as Charles’s fate was
    closing over him, were the Earl of Cleveland, Judge Jenkins, Sir Lewis
    Davies, and Sir John Stowell.</p>

  <p>At the time of the King’s death on the scaffold in front of the
    Banqueting House at Whitehall, many of his most devoted adherents were
    close prisoners in the Tower, among them being James, Duke of Hamilton,
    one of Charles’s closest friends, who had made a rash attempt to invade
    England in 1648, and, meeting Cromwell, was defeated and made prisoner
    at Uttoxeter. For fellows in misfortune the Duke had George Goring,
    Earl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> Norwich, Lord Capel, and the Earl of Holland—taken after the
    surrender of Colchester Castle—and Sir John Owen. The imprisonment of
    captured Royalists by the Parliament was but too often the prelude to
    their execution, but before the Duke and Lord Holland were beheaded,
    much interest was made to save them—more particularly Lord Holland; but
    Cromwell was obdurate, and they were both put to death in New Palace
    Yard. Lord Capel had succeeded in getting out of his prison. There
    is an interesting account of his escape and recapture given by Lord
    Clarendon in his “History,” and, although lengthy, may be quoted here
    as throwing an interesting light upon those times of revolution. “The
    Lord Capel, shortly after he was brought prisoner to the Tower from
    Windsor Castle, had, by a wonderful adventure, having a cord and all
    things necessary conveyed to him, let himself down out of the window
    of his chamber in the night, over the wall of the Tower, and had been
    directed through what part of the ditch he might be best able to wade.
    Whether he found the right place, or whether there was no safer place,
    he found the water and the mud so deep, that if he had not been by the
    head taller than other men, he must have perished, since the water
    came up to his chin. The way was so long to the other side, and the
    fatigue of drawing himself out of so much mud so intolerable, that his
    spirits were near spent, and he was once ready to call out for help,
    as thinking it better to be carried back to the prison, than to be
    found in such a place, from whence he could not extricate himself, and
    where he was ready to expire. But it pleased God that he got at last
    to the other side, where his friends expected him, and carried him to
    a chamber in the Temple, where he remained two or three nights secure
    from any discovery, notwithstanding the diligence that could not be
    used to recover a man they designed to use no better. After two or
    three days a friend whom he trusted much, and who had deserved to be
    trusted, conceiving he might be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> secure in a place to which there
    was less resort, and where there were so many harboured who were every
    day sought after, had provided a lodging for him in a private house in
    Lambeth Marsh; and calling upon him in an evening when it was dark, to
    go thither, they chose rather to take a boat they found ready at the
    Temple Stairs, than to trust one of that people with their secret, and
    it was so late that there was only one boat left there. In that the
    Lord Capel (as well disguised as he thought necessary) and his friend
    put themselves, and bid the waterman to row them to Lambeth. Whether,
    in their passage thither, the other gentleman called him ‘my lord,’
    as was confidently repeated, or whether the waterman had any jealousy
    by observing what he thought was a disguise, when they were landed,
    the wicked waterman undiscerned followed them, till he saw into what
    house they went; and then went to an officer and demanded: ‘What he
    would give him to bring him to the place where Lord Capel lay?’ And the
    officer promising to give him ten pounds, he led him presently to the
    house, where that excellent person was seized upon, and the next day
    carried to the Tower.”</p>

  <p>Lord Capel was after this sentenced to be hanged, but this was commuted
    to his being beheaded, the sentence being carried out in front of
    Westminster Hall on the 9th March 1649. Clarendon writes of him as
    being, “the noblest champion his party possessed; a man in whom the
    malice of his enemies could discover very few faults, and whom his
    friends could not wish better accomplished.” Arthur Capel had been
    created Baron Capel of Hadham in Hertfordshire by Charles I., and his
    son, Arthur, was created Earl of Essex by Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, coming, as we
    shall see, to a tragic end in the Tower in that monarch’s reign.</p>

  <p>Sir John Owen, that gallant Welsh knight, who had fought long and
    valiantly for the Royal cause, was taken prisoner at the engagement
    near Llandegas, and was imprisoned with the Duke of Hamilton and his
    fellow-Cavaliers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> at Windsor Castle before going to the Tower. At his
    trial Owen told his judges “that he was a plain gentleman of Wales,
    who had been taught to obey the King; that he had served him honestly
    during the war, and finding that many honest men endeavoured to raise
    forces whereby he might get out of prison, he did the like.” When he
    was condemned to be beheaded, he made his judges a low bow and said:
    “It was a great honour to a poor gentleman of Wales to lose his head
    with such noble lords; for, by God,” he added, “he was afraid they
    would have hanged him.” But the gallant old Cavalier did not lose his
    head, for Ireton stood up in the House and said that although the noble
    lords who had been condemned to death had many advocates, plain Sir
    John Owen had not one to speak for him. Ireton interceded so well, that
    Sir John was pardoned, and after a few months’ imprisonment in the
    Tower, was released. He went back to his beloved country, where he died
    in 1666, and rests in the church of Penmorven, in his native county of
    Carnarvonshire.</p>

  <p>The execution of the other Cavaliers caused much indignation, and,
    as was the fashion of the times, some pamphlets were written on the
    subject against those in power, Colonel John Lilburne being the most
    prominent of the pamphleteers. He, with three other writers, Walwayn,
    Prince, and Overton, were sent to the Tower by order of the Parliament
    for writing against its authority. Lilburne was banished the country,
    the others were liberated. The Colonel, who was known as “Freeborn
    John,” was a born pamphleteer, and no amount of prisons or pillories
    stopped his output of what was certainly seditious matter. There is a
    strong resemblance between “Freeborn John” and the French pamphleteer,
    Rochefort, of our own time, for whatever Government was in power he
    opposed it by his writings. In later life he became a Quaker, because
    he was determined to enjoy what he considered “Christian Liberty.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

  <p>The Parliament met with considerable opposition from the Lord Mayor of
    the city. In 1648 Lord Mayor Sir Abraham Reynardson was kept prisoner
    in the Tower for two months, because he refused to publish in the city
    the Ordinance of the House of Commons, abolishing the title of King.
    Sir Abraham was one of the city worthies. He had been Master of the
    Merchant Taylors Company in 1640–41, and had filled the highest civic
    post in the city for six months prior to his imprisonment, and had
    valiantly resisted the “turbulent disorders,” and the tyranny of the
    Rump Parliament, which had tried in vain to force the Corporation of
    London to follow its commands. Sir Abraham was not only imprisoned,
    but was also fined £2000, and degraded from the office of Lord Mayor.
    Reynardson’s generosity was great, and he is reported to have spent
    £20,000 whilst he was Lord Mayor, not inclusive of the heavy fine. But
    his loyalty to the Crown was unshaken, and he most willingly suffered
    both loss of office and fortune in the Royalist cause. His portrait,
    recently acquired by the Company of Merchant Taylors, is one of the
    most interesting features of their splendid hall. Sir Abraham was
    re-elected to the Lord Mayoralty on the return of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> (see
    C. M. Clode’s “Memoirs of Sir A. Reynardson”). The list of Royalist
    prisoners gained additions almost every month. At this time an agent
    of the young King’s, named Penruddock, was in the Tower with Sir John
    Gell, Colonel Eusebius Andrews, and Captains Benson and Ashley. Colonel
    Andrews, an old Royalist, was beheaded on Tower Hill; Gell, who was a
    Parliamentary General, and who left some interesting memoirs of the
    Civil War, was released after an imprisonment of two years. Benson was
    hanged at Tyburn, and Ashley was liberated. All these were suspected
    of plotting against the Parliament, and to them may be added Lords
    Beauchamp, Bellasis, and Chandos, committed to the Tower by the Council
    of State, “upon the suspicion of designing new troubles.” Lord Howard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
    of Escrick and a minister named Love were in the Tower at the same
    period—the former, who was a member of Parliament, being imprisoned
    on a charge of bribery whilst contesting the city of Carlisle; he
    was dismissed the House and fined £10,000. The minister, Christopher
    Love, had been a preacher at St Anne’s, Aldersgate, and St Lawrence’s,
    Jewry, and was the author of many theological works. After the death
    of Charles the First he became as violent a Royalist as he had been
    a republican, and was found to be in correspondence with Charles the
    Second. His pardon was eagerly begged by many London parishes, and by
    no less than fifty-four of the clergy, but all they could get was a
    respite for a month, and Love was beheaded in July 1651. His execution
    caused much stir, as is proved by the fact that a Dutch allegorical
    engraving was made of the scene, an engraving which, after those of the
    executions of Strafford and Laud, is the earliest representation of an
    execution on Tower Hill in existence. Lord Clarendon writes that “when
    Love was on the scaffold he appeared with a marvellous undauntedness.”
    In the same year, after the Battle of Worcester, the Tower was filled
    with the captured Royalists from that disastrous fight. With these came
    the Earls of Lauderdale, Kelly, and Rothes, General Massey and General
    Middleton, the earls being soon removed to Windsor Castle, where they
    remained prisoners until the Restoration. The two generals were enabled
    to escape from the Tower, and joined Charles in Paris, “to the grief
    and vexation of the very soul of Cromwell,” writes Clarendon. These
    constant escapes from the Tower during the power of the Parliament and
    the Commonwealth would seem to point to great laxity in its protection,
    or to sympathy on the part of its guardians with the prisoners.</p>

  <p>In the September of the following year the famous Edward Somerset,
    Marquis of Worcester, and Earl of Glamorgan, was a prisoner of
    the Commonwealth in the Tower. It was he who, with much show of
    probability,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> is supposed to have come within reasonable distance of
    inventing the steam-engine. He published in 1665 a book with a long
    title, which may be abbreviated into “A Century of Invention,” which
    Horace Walpole unkindly called “an amazing piece of folly.” Worcester
    died in 1667, and the model of his steam-engine is supposed to have
    been buried with him.</p>

  <p>During the closing years of the Protectorate most of the State
    prisoners in the Tower were those implicated in schemes for
    assassinating Cromwell. One of these schemes, in 1654, brought Lord
    Oxford, Sir Richard Willis, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, and his brother, John
    Gerrard, with other Cavaliers, to the fortress, charged with belonging
    to a set of conspirators who aimed at taking the Protector’s life. It
    was proved that they had met at a tavern where it was proposed to kill
    Cromwell, seize the Tower, and proclaim Prince Charles king. One of
    the conspirators, named Fox, turned what would now be called king’s
    evidence, with the result that two of his fellow-conspirators were
    executed—Vowel, who was hanged at Charing Cross, and John Gerrard, who
    was beheaded on Tower Hill.</p>

  <p>In the following year Cromwell made a raid among the officers of the
    Cavalier party, many of whom were seized and cashiered, Major-General
    Overton being sent to the Tower. Two other generals came there to bear
    him company in the same year, Generals Penn and Venables. They had
    made a disastrously unsuccessful expedition to the West Indies, which
    so exasperated Cromwell that on their return he ordered both of them
    to be imprisoned. A year later the Lieutenant of the Tower was ordered
    to release “one that goes by the name of Lucy Barlow, who for some
    time hath been a prisoner in the Tower of London. She passeth under
    the character of Charles Stuart’s wife; and hath a young son whom she
    openly declareth to be his; and it is generally believed; the boy being
    very like him; and both the mother and child provided for by him”
    (“Mercuris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> Politicus,” 1656). This Lucy Barlow was better known later
    on as Lucy Walters, and her son, who was then, and for some time to
    come, known by the name of James Crofts, became Duke of Monmouth.</p>

  <p>Clarendon describes at some length the strange story of the death in
    the Tower, in 1657, of Miles Syndercombe, once an intimate friend of
    Cromwell’s, but who for some unknown reason became involved in one
    of the many plots for assassinating the Protector. Syndercombe was
    sentenced to death, and it being expected that an attempt at his rescue
    might take place, he was most carefully guarded in his prison. On the
    morning of the day fixed for the execution, however, Syndercombe was
    found dead in his bed, but nevertheless the corpse was dragged at a
    horse’s tail to the place of execution, a stake being driven through it
    after it was buried: Cromwell’s enemies accused him of having caused
    his former friend to be poisoned.</p>

  <p>Cromwell, who, with all his natural courage lived in constant terror
    of assassination, in 1658 ordered all Royalists to live twenty
    miles away from London, and sent Colonel Russell, Sir William
    Compton, and Sir William Clayton, together with Henry Mordaunt, Lord
    Peterborough’s brother, to the Tower. Mordaunt had been in the young
    King’s employment, and, with a Dr Hewet, was put upon his trial for
    conspiracy. Mordaunt was acquitted, but Hewet was found guilty, and
    beheaded on Tower Hill. Another eminent Royalist, Sir Henry Slingsby, a
    great Yorkshire magnate who had fought for Charles, was also beheaded
    in the same year.</p>

  <p>During the short interval that elapsed between the death of Cromwell
    in September 1658 and the return of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> in May 1660, the Tower
    contained many important prisoners. Among them were Lady Mary Howard,
    the daughter of the Earl of Berkshire, and another lady, a Mrs Sumner,
    both of whom appear to have been mixed up in Mordaunt’s conspiracy
    against Cromwell, as well as a Mr Ernestus Byron and a Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> Harlow
    for the same cause. Other Royalists then in the fortress were Lord
    Falkland, Lord Delaware, the Earl of Chesterfield, Lords Falconbridge,
    Bellasis, Charles Howard, and Castleton, who had all taken part in a
    Royalist rising in Cheshire under the leadership of Sir George Booth.
    None of these, however, suffered more than a short imprisonment.</p>

  <p>While the faction of the Parliament was making a desperate stand
    against the military party in the government of the country, an
    attempt was made by the former to seize the Tower. “The Lieutenant,
    Colonel Fitz, had consented that Colonel Okey, with 300 men, should
    be dispersed in the vicinity prepared for the enterprise, promising
    that on a certain day he would cause the gates to be opened at an
    early hour for the passage of the Colonel’s carriage, at which time
    Colonel Okey with his men, embracing the opportunity, might seize the
    guards and make themselves masters of the place. This plot, however,
    was discovered, and on the night before its intended execution Colonel
    Desborough being despatched from the Army, with a body of horse,
    changed the guards, seized the Lieutenant, and placed a fresh garrison
    in the Tower under the command of Colonel Miller” (Ludlow’s “Memoirs”).</p>

  <p>Shortly after this episode, and during a disturbance amongst the
    soldiers there, Lenthal, the Speaker of the House of Commons, proceeded
    to the Tower, and removing the Lieutenant, who had been appointed by
    the Committee of Safety, conferred the government of the fortress upon
    Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper. But when General Monk declared for the King,
    that officer seized the fortress in the name of his royal master,
    released many of the prisoners, and placed in it a garrison commanded
    by Major Nicholson.</p>

  <p>It was now the turn of the Royalists, and in the month of March 1660,
    Sir Arthur Hazelrigge and Colonel John Lambert were placed in the Tower
    because they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> opposed Monk’s design for the restoration of the
    King, an event which showed the other members of the Committee in which
    direction the wind was blowing, and they made an attempt to secure
    the Tower by victualling the fortress, with the intention of standing
    a siege if it were necessary. Ludlow proposed that a force of two
    thousand men should join Colonel Morley’s regiment in the Tower, that
    the building itself should be stored with provisions for six months,
    and that two thousand sailors should also be placed within its walls as
    an additional security for its defence. This scheme, however, came to
    nothing.</p>

  <p>Samuel Pepys has given a description of how Lambert escaped from his
    prison in the Tower, “The manner of the escape of John Lambert out
    of the Tower, as related by Rugge:—That about eight of the clock at
    night he escaped by a rope tied fast to his window, by which he slid
    down, and in each hand he had a handkerchief; and six men were ready
    to receive him, who had a barge to hasten him away. She who made the
    bed, being privy to his escape, that night, to blind the warder when
    he came to lock the chamber door, went to bed, and possessed Colonel
    Lambert’s place and put on his night-cap. So, when the said warder came
    to lock the door according to his usual manner, he found the curtains
    drawn, and conceiving it to be Colonel Lambert, he said, ‘Good-night,
    my lord.’ To which a seeming voice replied, and prevented all further
    jealousies. The next morning, on coming to unlock the door, and espying
    her face, he cried out, ‘In the name of God, Joan, what makes you here?
    Where is my Lord Lambert?’ She said, ‘He is gone; but I cannot tell
    whither.’ Whereupon he caused her to rise and carried her before the
    officer in the Tower, and (she) was committed to custody. Some said
    that a lady knit for him a garter of silk, by which he was conveyed
    down, and that she received £100 for her pains.”</p>

  <p>Lambert was, however, retaken by Colonel Ingoldsby in Warwickshire,
    together with some other Roundhead <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>officers who had joined him, and
    he was again placed in the Tower. At the Restoration he was banished
    to Guernsey, where he remained a prisoner until his death in 1683.
    Lambert had a high military reputation amongst the Roundheads, and had
    contributed greatly to the victory at Naseby, as well as defeating the
    Royalists both in Scotland and in the Midlands: his fame was such that
    Cromwell was supposed to have been somewhat jealous of his successes.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">CHARLES <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> after the return of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> in the month of May 1660,
    the trials and executions of the late King’s judges began. The first
    of the regicides to be sent to the Tower was Major-General Thomas
    Harrison, who was committed for high treason on 19th May, and on the
    11th of the following October, drawn on a hurdle to Charing Cross, and
    there hanged and quartered. Harrison, who was the son of a Nantwich
    butcher, and had been bred for the law, had been useful to the
    Protector in keeping down the Presbyterian faction. He died stoutly
    asserting the righteousness of the cause for which he suffered. The
    same fate befell Gregory Clement and Colonel John James, both members
    of the High Court of Justice which had condemned Charles I. Clement
    had succeeded in hiding himself in a house near Gray’s Inn, but was
    discovered and brought before the Commissioners of the Militia, to
    whom, however, he was not known by sight. He would probably have
    escaped, when it chanced that a blind man came into the room as Clement
    was quitting it, and recognised him by his voice, upon which Clement
    was arrested and sent to the Tower (Ludlow’s “Memoirs”). Among the
    other regicides confined within the Tower during that summer were
    Colonel Bamfield, Colonel Hunks, Colonel Phair, Francis Corker, Captain
    Hewlet, and John Cook, the last of whom had conducted the prosecution
    against the King. Hewlet was accused of having been one of the masked
    executioners at Whitehall, but this was never proved.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

  <p>James Harrington, the author of the political romance called “The
    Commonwealth of Oceana,” was imprisoned in the Tower early in this
    reign. He became insane, and was transferred from prison to prison.
    His book, by which he was made famous, laid down a plea for a lasting
    republic, the government of which was to be maintained by rotation.
    This unhappy author died in 1677, and was laid near Sir Walter Raleigh
    in St Margaret’s, Westminster.</p>

  <p>In the same summer of Charles’s restoration, the Marquis of Argyll, who
    was shortly afterwards beheaded at Edinburgh, was a prisoner in the
    Tower charged with high treason, and with having sided with Cromwell;
    with him was the Marquis of Antrim. The Laird of Swinton was another
    prisoner of this year, being imprisoned upon various charges, one of
    which was that he intended to kill the King whilst pretending to be
    touched by Charles for “the evil”—<i>i.e.</i> scrofula; and also for
    deserting the army at the Battle of Dunbar.</p>

  <p>The next illustrious name that one comes to in the portentous annals
    of the Tower is that of Sir Harry Vane, whose death was a monstrous
    injustice, Charles confessing as much when he himself said of Vane that
    “he was too dangerous a man to let live, if we can honestly put him
    out of the way.” Although Vane had much to do in bringing Strafford
    to his death, he was not in any way concerned with the execution of
    Charles I., and had, on the contrary, always been opposed to that
    great mistake. However, in the month of July 1660, he was sent to the
    Tower, whence he was taken to be imprisoned in the Scilly Isles, then
    brought back to the Tower in March 1662, and beheaded on Tower Hill
    in that same year. At his trial he had pleaded Charles’s promise of
    a “merciful indemnity to all those not immediately concerned in his
    father’s death,” which should, at any rate, have saved Sir Harry from
    the scaffold. But Vane was too good a man for Charles to tolerate, and
    his execution was a judicial murder of the basest kind. Both Houses
    of Parliament had voted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> for an Act of Indemnity in Vane’s favour,
    but they were overruled by the King and his creatures. Pepys took the
    trouble to rise early on the morning of the 14th of June to see Vane’s
    execution. “Up by four o’clock in the morning and upon business in my
    office. Then we sat down to business, and about eleven o’clock, having
    a room got ready for us, we all went out to the Tower Hill; and there,
    over against the scaffold, made on purpose this day, saw Sir Harry Vane
    brought. A very great press of people. He made a long speech, many
    times interrupted by the Sheriffs and others there, and they would have
    taken his paper out of his hand, but he would not let it go. But they
    caused all the books of those that writ after him (reporters?) to be
    given to the Sheriffe, and the trumpets were brought under the scaffold
    that he might not be heard. Then he prayed, and so fitted himself, and
    received the blow; but the scaffold was so crowded that we could not
    see it done.” Sir Harry had been a thorn in Cromwell’s flesh, and the
    Protector’s exclamation, “The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!” is
    historical.</p>

  <p>To return to the year 1660, Colonels Axten and Hacker, the latter of
    whom had commanded the guard at the King’s trial and at his execution,
    together with one of his judges, Thomas Scott, were hanged at Charing
    Cross.</p>

  <p>In October of the same year, Henry Martin, one of the most prominent
    of the regicides, was imprisoned for life, and died twenty years later
    in Chepstow Castle. Another was General Edmund Ludlow, author of the
    “Memoirs,” who died in Switzerland, after an exile of thirty-two
    years. Some twenty persons in all were executed in the most brutal
    fashion, while the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, and the greatest
    sailor that England ever had before Nelson, Blake, were torn from
    their graves in the Abbey, gibbeted at Tyburn, and buried beneath the
    gallows, Cromwell’s head having been cut from the body and stuck up on
    Westminster Hall. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>Charles’s government respected neither the dead
    nor the rights of nations in the matter of taking vengeance upon the
    late King’s judges.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_058">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Old Cannon and Mortars on the west side of the White Tower</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>On the 22nd of April 1661, Charles left Whitehall in state for the
    Tower, to prepare for his coronation in the Abbey the following day, as
    was the custom. Charles the Second was the last of our sovereigns to
    sleep in the Tower on the eve of his coronation, he being lodged that
    night in the royal apartments on the southern side of the White Tower,
    the greater part of the Palace, including the Great Hall, having been
    pulled down during the Protectorate.</p>

  <p>We will let Pepys recount the procession from the Tower—where, as was
    also the custom, Charles had created a number of Knights of the Bath—to
    Whitehall. “Up early and made myself as fine as I could, and put on my
    velvet coat, the first day that I put it on, though made half a year
    ago. And being ready, Sir W. Batten, my Lady, and his two daughters,
    and his son and wife, and Sir W. Penn, and his son and I, went to Mr
    Young’s, the flagmaker, in Corne-hill; and there we had a good room
    to ourselves, with wine and good cake, and saw the show very well. In
    which it is impossible to relate the glory of the day, expressed in the
    clothes of them that rid, and their horses and horse-clothes, among
    others my Lord Sandwich’s embroidery and diamonds were ordinary among
    them. The Knights of the Bath was a brave show of itself; and their
    Esquires, among which Mr Armiger was an Esquire to one of the Knights.
    Remarquable were the two men that represented the two Dukes of Normandy
    and Aquitaine. The Bishops came next after Barons, which is the higher
    place; which makes me think that the next Parliament they will be
    called to the House of Lords. My Lord Monk rode bare after the King,
    and led in his hand a spare horse, as being the Master of the Horse;
    the King, in a most rich and embroidered suit and cloak, looked most
    noble. Wadlow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> the vintner (Wadlow was the original of ‘Sir Simon the
    King,’ the favourite air of Squire Western in ‘Tom Jones’) at the Devil
    in Flete Streete, did lead a fine company of soldiers, all young comely
    men, in white doublets. Then followed the Vice-Chamberlain, Sir G.
    Carteret, a company of men all like Turks; but I know not yet what they
    are for. The streets all gravelled, and the houses hung with carpets
    before them, made brave show, and the ladies out of the windows, one of
    which over against us I took much notice of, and spoke to her, which
    made good sport among us. Glorious was the show with gold and silver,
    that we were not able to look at it, our eyes at last being so much
    overcome with it. Both the King and the Duke of York took notice of us,
    as they saw us at the window.”</p>

  <p>Another contemporary writer says: “Even the vaunting French confessed
    their pomps of the late marriage with the Infanta of Spain (the wedding
    of Louis <abbr title="14th">XIV.</abbr> with Maria Theresa of Spain) at their Majesties’ entrance
    into Paris, to be inferior in state, gallantry, and riches, to this
    most glorious cavalcade from the Tower.”</p>

  <p>The same year that saw the coronation of Charles witnessed a strange
    form of punishment to three prisoners in the Tower. These were Lord
    Monson, Sir Henry Mildmay, and Robert Wallop, who were imprisoned for
    holding republican views. They were sentenced to lose their rank,
    to be drawn on hurdles to Tyburn from the Tower and back again, and
    imprisoned for life.</p>

  <p>A large number of other political prisoners were sent to the different
    prisons throughout the country, and many were also shipped off to the
    Pacific Islands, where they were sold as slaves. Perhaps the worst case
    of any was that of three of the late King’s judges who had escaped into
    Holland. They were seized in that country by an emissary of the English
    Government, and, against all the laws of nations, brought back to
    England, imprisoned in the Tower, and suffered death as felons. These
    three <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>men were Colonel Okey—whom we mentioned as having attempted
    to seize the Tower after Cromwell’s death—Colonel Barkstead, and Miles
    Corbet. They were executed in April 1662. Barkstead had been knighted
    by Cromwell, the Parliament had entrusted him with the custody of
    the Tower, and he had also acted as Major-General of London. He is
    supposed to have enriched himself whilst head of the Tower, by exacting
    money from the prisoners in his keeping. His head was placed over the
    Traitor’s Gate in the Tower. Although he and his companions may have
    deserved their fate, the manner of their seizure reflects the greatest
    discredit upon the government of Charles, which, as I have already
    said, neither respected the rights of the living nor reverenced the
    dead.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Between the years 1660 and 1667, some necessary repairs were undertaken
    in the Tower, some five hundred pounds being expended thereon. In
    1680 more extensive repairs were made, owing to reports made by
    members of the House of Lords who had been appointed by the King in
    Council, to inquire into “repairs and other works to be done, in and
    about the said Tower of London, for the safety and convenience of the
    garrison therein” (Harleian MSS.). An elaborate report was drawn up,
    the estimate for the necessary alterations amounting to £6097, 2s.,
    but like most of the important undertakings at that time, little, if
    anything, was accomplished. The order for these repairs issued by the
    Treasury stated that the above sum would be provided “so soon as the
    state of His Majesty’s affairs would permit”: but knowing the state of
    Charles’s “affairs,” we may be sure nothing came of it.</p>

  <p>During the Great Fire of 1666, the Tower ran the most perilous risk in
    all its history of utter destruction, and it was only by the timely
    blowing up of the buildings which abutted on the walls of the fortress
    and by the side of the moat, that the historical structure was saved.
    The conflagration began at midnight on the 1st September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> in a house
    in Pudding Lane, not far from where the monument erected in its
    commemoration now stands. Pepys, that most invaluable of chroniclers
    and domestic historians, then lived in Seething Lane, Crutched Friars.
    “Lord’s Day, 2nd September,” he writes: “I made myself ready presently,
    and walked to the Tower, and there got up upon one of the high
    places (perhaps Pepys mounted to the top of the White Tower), Sir J.
    Robinson’s little son going up with me. And there I did see the houses
    at that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire in
    this and the other side of this and of that bridge.” On the seventh of
    this September Pepys bears witness to the King’s energy in bringing
    assistance to the sufferers by the conflagration. “In the meantime,” he
    writes, “his Majesty got to the Tower by water, to demolish the houses
    about the Graffs (?), which being built entirely about it, had they
    taken fire, and attacked the White Tower where the magazine of powder
    lay, would undoubtedly not only have beaten down and destroyed all the
    bridge, but sunk and torn the vessels in the river, and rendered the
    demolition beyond expression, for several miles about the country.”</p>

  <p>Charles certainly showed the Stuart courage as well as resourcefulness
    at a crisis, for there can be little doubt that he was chiefly
    instrumental in saving the Tower, by ordering the blowing up of the
    dangerous buildings attached to its walls.</p>

  <p>In Hollar’s panoramic view of London before and after the Great Fire,
    here reproduced, it will be seen how very close was the approach of
    the conflagration to the walls of the ancient fortress. Another danger
    threatened the Tower in this same year, a Captain Rathbone, with some
    other officers, having formed a plan for scaling the outer walls, and
    killing Sir John Robinson,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> after securing the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>gates. It was one
    of the Anti-Royalist plots with which the period was so rife, and, like
    the majority of them, ended in failure; Rathbone and his gang were
    taken prisoners and promptly hanged at Tyburn.</p>

  <p>Among other prisoners there at this time was Thomas, Lord Buller of
    Moor Park, incarcerated for having challenged the Duke of Buckingham
    to a duel, and also the Marquis of Dorchester, for “quarrelling with
    and using ill language to that duke”; the latter was likewise in the
    Tower, and not for the first time. On this occasion Buckingham was
    charged with treasonable correspondence and with stirring up a mutiny
    in the Army. Few persons of the time were so frequently made acquainted
    with the prison chambers of the Tower as this roystering ne’er-do-well,
    “that life of pleasure, and that soul of whim,” George Villiers, Duke
    of Buckingham, who was, in all, five times confined in the Tower, his
    first visit having been paid during the Protectorate because he had
    married Fairfax’s daughter, an event that greatly enraged Cromwell.
    In 1666 he was imprisoned for insulting Lord Ossory, the son of the
    Duke of Ormond, in the House of Lords. But he was never a prisoner for
    long, the last occasion being when, together with Shaftesbury, Wharton,
    and Salisbury, he opposed the “Courtiers’ Parliament.” All four were
    sent to the Tower, but Buckingham, after making a humble apology,
    was released. On leaving the Tower he passed under Shaftesbury’s
    windows; the latter had refused to submit. “What,” said Shaftesbury
    to Buckingham, “are you leaving us?” “Why, yes,” answered Buckingham,
    “such <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>giddy fellows as I am can never stay long in one place.”</p>

  <p>Constantly in trouble, Buckingham was so boon a companion of the King’s
    that Charles could not long let him remain out of his sight, whatever
    the follies of which the Duke might have been guilty. Another of these
    brilliant but dissipated friends and courtiers of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> who was
    sent to the Tower, was the infamously famous John Wilmot, Earl of
    Rochester. He was there in 1669 for having abducted Elizabeth Mallet,
    “la triste héritière,” as Grammont calls her. Ultimately Rochester
    married the lady, and she made a most devoted wife to a most worthless
    and unfaithful husband.</p>

  <p>Charles had been greatly irritated by the preference of the beautiful
    Frances Stuart, “la Belle Stewart” of Grammont, for the Duke of
    Richmond, and his rival had to pass three weeks in the Tower in
    consequence of the Royal jealousy. The Duke, however, had his way, and
    married the fair Frances after eloping with her. Another of Charles’s
    courtiers was placed in the fortress in 1665, Lord Morley, for having
    killed a Mr Hastings. Morley was a noted duellist, and also what was
    afterwards termed a “Mohawk,” and aided by one, Bromwich, had murdered
    his victim in a street brawl.</p>

  <p>Pepys, we have noted, was often in and about the Tower during these
    years, but the most interesting entry in his diary relating to the
    fortress, belongs to the year 1662. Under the date of the 20th October
    he writes: “To my Lord Sandwich, who was in his chamber all alone, and
    did inform me that an old acquaintance hath discovered to him £7000
    hid in the Tower, of which he was to have two for the discovery, my
    lord two, and the King the other three, when it is found; and the
    King’s warrant to search, runs for me and one Mr Lee. So we went, and
    the guard at the Tower Gate making me leave my sword, I was forced to
    stay so long at the alehouse close by, till my boy run home for my
    cloak. Then walked to Minchen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>Lane, and got from Sir H. Bennet the
    King’s warrant for the paying of £2000 to my lord and other two of the
    discoverers. After dinner we broke the matter to the Lord Mayor, who
    did not, and durst not, appear the least averse to it. So Lee and I
    and Mr Wade were joined by Evett, the guide, W. Giffin, and a porter
    with pickaxes. Coming to the Tower, our guide demanded a candle, and
    down into the cellars he goes. He went into several little cellars and
    then out-of-doors to view, but none did answer so well to the marks
    as one arched vault, where after much talk, to digging we went, till
    about eight o’clock at night, but could find nothing, yet the guides
    were not discouraged. Locking the door, we left for the night, and
    up to the Deputy Governor, and he do undertake to keep the key, that
    none shall go down without his privity. <em>November 1st.</em> To the
    Tower to make one trial more, where we staid several hours, and dug a
    great deal under the arches, but we missed of all and so we went away
    the second time like fools. To the Dolphin Tower. Met Wade and Evett,
    who do say that they had from Barkstead’s own mouth.” Pepys and his
    fellow treasure-hunters then paused in their operations, but on the
    17th December we read in this Diary, “This morning were Lee, Wade, and
    Evett, intending to have gone upon our new design upon the Tower, but
    it raining, and the work being done in the open garden, we put it off
    to Friday next.” And this is the last we hear of the Tower treasure,
    and for all that we know that £7000 is still under some vault in the
    old building, hidden in the “butter firkins” in which it was supposed
    to have been placed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Three years after the Great Fire, Pepys gives an account of a visit he
    paid to his friend Sir William Coventry on the 11th of March 1669, when
    he went to see him in what was then called “My Lord of Northumberland’s
    Walk,” a place not now to be identified, which had at its end an iron
    shield with the Earl’s arms engraved upon it and holes in which to
    place a peg for every turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> made by the pedestrian during his walk:
    this must have been the prison exercise of the so-called “Wizard Earl,”
    Raleigh’s friend.</p>

  <p>Pepys visited his friend Sir William Coventry very frequently when the
    latter was imprisoned in the Tower. Sir William had, through the medium
    of Henry Savile, challenged the Duke of Buckingham to a duel in March
    1669, and three days after the challenge Savile was committed to the
    Gate House Prison, and Coventry to the Tower.</p>

  <p>Savile was a gentleman of the Duke of York’s, who, being indignant at
    the slight put upon him by being sent to the Gate House, asked if he
    might not be sent to the Tower, and his wish was granted. Pepys was
    unremitting in his attentions to his old friend Coventry, although by
    constantly seeing him he was placing himself in the black books of
    Charles and the Duke of York. We find him calling, on March 4th, upon
    Coventry in his prison in the Brick Tower when he was in charge of a
    son of “Major Bayly’s, one of the officers of the Ordnance,” again on
    the following day he visits him and finds Coventry, “with abundance
    of company with him.” The visits were continued on the following days
    until the 16th of the same month, after which Coventry was liberated.
    The stir his imprisonment had made, and the number of visitors who
    called upon him—in one day some sixty coaches stood waiting outside
    the Tower Gates for those who called on Sir William—had much annoyed
    the King, the Duke of York, and Buckingham. Sir William Coventry, of
    whom Bishop Burnet writes that he was “a man of great notions and
    eminent virtue; the best speaker in the House of Commons, and capable
    of bearing the chief ministry, as it was once thought he was very near
    it, and deserved it more than all the rest did,” after this quarrel
    with Buckingham and his imprisonment in the Tower retired from public
    affairs, going to Minster Lovel in Oxfordshire, and dying at the age of
    sixty, in 1686. He had been Secretary of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>the Admiralty, and twice
    member for Yarmouth, and in 1667 had been one of the Commission of the
    Treasury.</p>

  </div>

  <p>There is a blank in the list of commitments to the Tower between the
    years 1668 and 1678. They are supposed to have been lost, but we know
    that the year after Pepys’ friend Sir John Robinson had ceased to
    command in the Tower, the gossiping diarist himself was a prisoner
    within the walls, having been in some way concerned in the so-called
    Popish Plot of 1679. It is greatly to be deplored that no account of
    Samuel’s experiences in the Tower have come down to us, for his diary
    ends ten years before this date: Pepys was in the Tower from the month
    of May 1679 until the following February. His expenses, however,
    have been recorded:—“For safe keeping of Sir Anthony Deane and Mr
    Pepys, from and for the 22nd day of May 1679 unto and for the 24th of
    June 1679, being four weeks and six dayes, at £3 per week, ancient
    allowance, and 13s. 4d. per weeke, present demands, according to the
    retrenchments, £6, 9s. 6d.” (Bayley’s “Tower of London.”)</p>

  <p>Among other prisoners in the Tower in this reign was Nathaniel
    Desborow, or Disbrew, as his name is sometimes written. Desborow was
    Cromwell’s brother-in-law, “clumsy and ungainly in his person,” and, a
    born plotter, he hated all who were placed above him. He had been made
    Chancellor of Ireland by his nephew Richard Cromwell, but nevertheless
    he helped to pull down the Protector’s son and successor from his
    short-lived position. There were many others besides, imprisoned for
    political and non-political offences, and of the latter was Stephen
    Thomson, who was imprisoned for “stealing and conveying beyond the seas
    the sole daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund Alleyn, deceased, she being
    an infant.”</p>

  <p>The most sensational event that occurred in the Tower during the reign
    of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was the attempt made by a ruffian who called himself
    “Colonel” Blood to steal the Crown and Regalia. Blood, half sailor,
    half highwayman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> and a complete scoundrel, was about fifty years
    old when, in the month of May 1671, he made what was literally a
    dash for the Crown. Blood appears to have served under Cromwell, and
    consequently styled himself “Colonel”; after the war he became a spy of
    the Government, and a short time before his performance at the Tower
    he had almost succeeded in having the old Duke of Ormond hanged on the
    gallows at Tyburn.</p>

  <p>At this time Sir Gilbert Talbot held the appointment of “Master of the
    Jewel House.” The allowance for this charge had been reduced, and, as
    a kind of compensation, the Master had permission to allow the public
    to inspect the Regalia, then kept in the Martin Tower, or Jewel Tower,
    as it was then called, a fee being charged which became the Master’s
    perquisite. Three weeks before Blood made his attempt, he had called
    at the Martin Tower disguised as a clergyman, “with a long cloak,
    cassock, and canonical girdle.” He was accompanied by a woman whom
    he represented as his wife. The lady requested permission to see the
    Regalia, but soon after being admitted to the Tower complained of “a
    qualm upon her stomach,” and old Talbot Edwards, who had been an old
    servant of Sir Gilbert’s, and had been placed by him in charge of the
    Regalia, called to his wife to look after the <i lang="la">soi-disant</i> Mrs
    Blood. That lady having been given something to remove her “qualms”
    was, together with her husband, most profuse in the expression of her
    gratitude to the old keeper and his wife, and promised to return upon
    an early occasion.</p>

  <p>The next time Blood came to the Tower he was alone, bringing some
    gloves for Edwards’s wife as a token of gratitude for the kindness
    shown to “Mrs Blood.” On this occasion he informed Edwards that he had
    a young nephew who was well off, and in search of a wife, and suggested
    that a match might be arranged between him and their daughter. Blood
    was invited to bring his nephew to make the acquaintance of the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
    lady, and it was arranged that the old couple should give a dinner at
    which the meeting should take place. At the dinner Blood took it upon
    himself, being still in his clerical disguise, to say grace, which he
    did with great unction, concluding with a long-winded oration, and a
    prayer for the Royal family. After the meal he visited the rooms in the
    Tower, and seeing a fine pair of pistols hanging on the wall, asked
    if he might buy them to give to a friend. He then said that he would
    return with a couple of friends who were about to leave London, and who
    were anxious to see the Regalia before leaving, it being decided that
    he should bring them the next morning. That day was the 9th of May,
    and at seven in the morning old Talbot Edwards was ready to receive
    his reverend friend and his companions, who soon put in an appearance.
    Blood and his confederates had arms concealed about them, each carrying
    daggers, pocket pistols, and rapier blades in their canes.</p>

  <p>They were taken up the stairs into the room where the Regalia was kept,
    but immediately they had entered, the ruffians threw a cloak over
    Edwards’s head and gagged him with a wooden plug, which had a small
    hole in it so that the person gagged could breathe; this they fastened
    with a piece of waxed leather which encircled his neck, and placed an
    iron hook on his nose so as to prevent him from crying out. They swore
    they would murder him if he attempted to give an alarm—which the poor
    old fellow could scarcely have done under the circumstances. But the
    plucky old keeper struggled hard, whereupon they beat him upon the head
    with a wooden mallet, and stabbed him until he fainted. The villains,
    thinking they had killed him, then turned their attention to rifling
    the treasures in the room. One of them, Parrot, put the orb in his
    breeches pocket, Blood placed the Crown under his cloak, and the third
    began to file the sceptre in two pieces, it being too long to carry
    away without being seen. At this moment steps were heard;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> Edwards’s
    young son having just returned from Flanders in the very nick of time.
    The thieves dashed down the stairs past the young man who was coming
    up, carrying with them the orb and crown, the sceptre being left behind
    in the hurry of their flight. The pursuit was immediate; young Edwards
    had brought with him his brother-in-law, a Captain Beckman, and the
    latter hearing cries of “Treason! Murder!” from the terrified women in
    the Tower, and the cry “The Crown is stolen!” rushed after Blood and
    the two other men. These had meanwhile crossed the drawbridge between
    the Main Guard at the White Tower and the Wharf; at the bridge a warder
    had tried to stop them, but Blood fired his pistol, and the man,
    although not wounded, fell to the ground, and they dashed past him. At
    St Katharine’s Gate, near which horses were in waiting for the thieves,
    Beckman overtook them; Blood again discharged his pistol but missed
    his pursuer, who ducking his head, promptly seized the sham clergyman,
    from under whose cloak the Crown fell to the ground, rolling in the
    gutter. Then followed what the <cite>London Gazette</cite> of the day called
    a “robustious struggle,” Blood ultimately being secured, remarking that
    “It was a gallant attempt, for it was for a Crown!”</p>

  <p>When the Crown fell to the ground, some of the gems came loose from
    their settings, and a large ruby, which had belonged to the sceptre,
    was found in Parrot’s pocket. Little harm, however, was done, except to
    the poor old keeper, who was nearly eighty years of age and had been
    terribly injured; he was soon past all suffering, and was buried in the
    Chapel of St Peter’s, where his gravestone can still be seen.</p>

  <p>After his capture Blood occupied a prison in the White Tower for a
    short time, but the King soon sent for him. And although it is not,
    and cannot be known, whether Charles was an accessory or not in the
    attempted theft, or whether Blood knew too much of the King’s affairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
    yet, whatever the reason, Blood was not only pardoned but rewarded, the
    King giving him a pension of £500 a year, and bestowing upon him landed
    estates in Ireland, the “Colonel” becoming one of the most assiduous
    of the Whitehall courtiers. Whether Charles also rewarded Blood’s
    accomplices is not recorded, but none of them were ever punished for
    the attempted robbery. John Evelyn recounts meeting Blood at court
    on the 10th of May 1671. “How he came to be pardoned,” he writes,
    “and ever received into favour, not only after this but several other
    exploits almost as daring, both in Ireland and here, I never could
    come to understand. This man had not only a daring, but a villainous
    unmerciful look, a false countenance, but very well-spoken, and
    dangerously insinuating.”</p>

  <p>Charles the Second, always in want of money, might very possibly have
    commissioned Blood, after he had stolen the Crown, to pawn or sell its
    gems in Holland or elsewhere, and the thieves could then have divided
    the spoil. There can be little doubt that had not young Edwards and
    his brother-in-law arrived at the Tower when they did, Blood and the
    two, or others, would have got safely away with the jewels. The plot
    had been admirably planned, and only the accident of the return of the
    keeper’s son, which Blood could not possibly have foreseen, prevented
    its successful accomplishment.</p>

  <p>In later years Blood is said to have become a Quaker—not a desirable
    recruit for that most respectable body, one would imagine. He died in
    1680, and has had the honour of having had his bold, bad face placed in
    the National Portrait Gallery; it fully bears out Evelyn’s description
    of the “villainous unmerciful” look of the man.</p>

  <p>A very different individual from Blood, who was also in the Tower about
    the same time, was William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. He had
    been imprisoned for no offence, unless that of writing a pamphlet on
    Unitarianism could be considered a punishable crime. William Penn’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
    father, the celebrated Admiral, Sir William, had accused the Duke of
    York of showing cowardice in a sea fight with the Dutch, and the son’s
    pamphlet was made the stick with which to beat the father. Young Penn
    passed some months in the Tower, where he wrote his famous work, “No
    Cross, no Crown.” Edward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester, was sent
    to the Tower to see, and to convert, the young Quaker from his errors
    in belief, but Penn only said to the prelate: “The Tower is to me the
    worst argument in the world,” and Stillingfleet found that he could
    make no impression.</p>

  <p>In 1678, William Howard, Viscount Stafford, a Roman Catholic peer, was
    accused of being concerned in the Popish Plot, that monstrous tangle
    of lies, invented, for the greater part, by the infamous Titus Oates.
    Stafford was accused by Oates, with four other Roman Catholic peers,
    of being mixed up in the plot to overthrow the King, and to place the
    Duke of York upon the throne. From his place in the House of Lords
    Stafford had declared his innocence of the charge, but he was committed
    to close imprisonment in the Tower in the month of October (1678),
    remaining a prisoner until the month of November 1680, when he was
    tried at Westminster Hall, Titus Oates being the principal witness
    against him. In Reresby’s “Memoirs” it is said that Charles wished
    to save Stafford, whom he knew to be innocent; but his mistress, the
    Duchess of Portsmouth, whom Reresby believed to have been bribed,
    prevented the King from acting in the matter as he would otherwise have
    done, and Charles allowed an innocent man to be judicially murdered in
    order not to thwart his mistress’s wishes. Stafford was beheaded on
    Tower Hill on the 29th of December 1680, the crowd hooting him on his
    way to the scaffold, for Titus Oates’s infamous accusations had made
    any Roman Catholic an object of hatred to the populace. On Stafford
    asking one of the Sheriffs, of the name of Cornish, to interfere, the
    latter brutally replied: “I am ordered to stop no man’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>mouth but
    your own.” So fervently, however, did Stafford proclaim his innocence
    on the scaffold, that many of the spectators, “with heads uncovered,
    exclaimed: ‘We believe you, God bless you, my Lord!’” “He perished,”
    writes Sir J. Reresby, “in the firmest denial of what had been laid to
    his charge, and that in so cogent and persuasive a manner, that all
    the beholders believed his words, and grieved his destiny.” The same
    tribunal which had condemned Stafford, three years after his death
    reversed the attainder they had pronounced against him, it having, in
    the meanwhile, been proved that Stafford had perished an innocent man,
    done to death by the false witness of the villain Oates. Lord Stafford
    was buried in the Chapel of St Peter’s.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>William, Lord Russell.</i><br />
      <span class="small">(<i>From the Portrait in the National Portrait Gallery</i>)</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The Rye House Plot brought two of the best and noblest heads in England
    to the block—William, Lord Russell, and Algernon Sidney. Both suffered
    death for the good cause of the liberty of England. Russell was the
    proto-martyr in that faith, Sidney the second.</p>

  <p>England under Charles the Second was fast drifting back into the worst
    of the tyrannies that had darkened her former history. The King, as he
    proved on his death-bed, was a Roman Catholic in religion, and although
    professing to belong to the Church of England, moved in the steps
    of his brother James, who was an avowed Papist; and the country was
    rapidly becoming, politically, a dependency of the French King, and,
    in religion, a fief of the Pope. The four most conspicuous Englishmen
    who clearly saw the danger that threatened the freedom, both civil and
    religious, of England, and who had done their utmost to save their
    country—patriots in the best sense of that much-abused term, were at
    the time of the discovery of the Rye House Plot in 1683, either out of
    the country or in prison.</p>

  <p>Shaftesbury, after an imprisonment of five weeks in the Tower, had
    crossed to Holland after his liberation in November 1681. The news of
    his acquittal had been received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> with great rejoicings in the city,
    Reresby writing that “the rabble lighted bonfires.” The Duke of York,
    according to Lenthall, expressed his indignation publicly at “such
    insolent defiance of authority such as he had never before known.” But
    Shaftesbury’s friends and admirers had a medal struck in honour of his
    liberation, on one side being the Earl’s portrait in profile, and on
    the other a view of London taken from the Southwark side of the Thames,
    with the sun casting its rays over the Tower from out the clouds; above
    is inscribed the word, “Laetamur,” with the date 24 of November 1681
    beneath. This medal gave rise to Dryden’s satirical poem called “The
    Medal,” in which he compares Shaftesbury to Achitophel.</p>

  <p>Russell, Sidney, and Essex were arrested and placed in the prisons of
    the Tower. They suffered death in the cause of constitutional liberty,
    as against the arbitrary power of the King, and also for wishing to
    exclude the Duke of York from the succession to the throne after his
    brother’s death. This plan was quite distinct from the Rye House Plot—a
    plot that arranged for the assassination of the King and the Duke of
    York on their road to Newmarket races.</p>

  <p>Russell and Sidney were betrayed by Lord Howard of Escrick, and
    although warned of his danger, Russell, unlike Shaftesbury, refused
    to flee, saying he had done nothing to make him fear meeting the
    justice of his country. However, on entering the Tower, he seems to
    have had a foreboding of his fate, for turning round to his attendant,
    Taunton, he said he knew that there was “a determination against him
    to take his life, for the devil is unchained.” “From the moment of his
    arrest,” writes Bishop Burnet, “he looked upon himself as a dying man,
    and turned his thoughts wholly to another world. He read much in the
    Scriptures, particularly in the Psalms. But, whilst he behaved with
    the serenity of a man prepared for death, his friends exhibited an
    honourable anxiety to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> save his life. Lord Essex would not leave his
    house, lest his absconding might incline a jury to give more credit to
    the evidence against Lord Russell. The Duke of Monmouth offered to come
    in and share fortunes with him, if it would do him any service. But he
    answered, ‘It would be of no advantage to him to have his friends die
    with him.’”</p>

  <p>During the fortnight which elapsed between his arrest and his sentence,
    Russell’s devoted wife did all that was humanly possible to save her
    husband’s life, and the night before the trial she wrote to him: “Your
    friends believe I can do you some service at your trial. I am certainly
    willing to try; my resolution will hold out, pray let yours. But it may
    be the Court will not let me. However, do let me try.” Lady Russell not
    only tried, but succeeded in being of assistance to her husband during
    his trial, which took place in Westminster Hall on July 13th, 1683.
    Lord Russell asked his judges if he might have “some one to help his
    memory,” as he put it, and the request being granted, “My wife,” he
    said, “is here to do it.” And all through that long summer day, whilst
    he was being tried for his life, Lady Russell sat by her husband’s side
    writing down notes of the evidence, and giving him her advice. When the
    news came, during the course of the trial, that Essex had been found in
    the Tower with his throat cut, Russell burst into tears. He wept for
    the fate of his friend, whilst his own misfortunes only made him appear
    the more serene and indifferent to the malice of his enemies. Jeffries,
    who presided, took care in his charge to the jury to turn Essex’s
    untimely end into an additional proof of Russell’s guilt.</p>

  <p>Essex had been arrested soon after Russell, and on the same charge,
    that of being concerned in the Rye House Plot, and was accused of high
    treason. Taken from his seat at Cassiobury to the Tower, he was placed
    in the same room which was occupied by his father. It is described
    in the depositions placed before the Commissioners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> in William the
    Third’s time, as being “on the left hand as you go up the mound, after
    passing the Bloody Tower Gate.” In Dalrymple’s history it is stated
    that Essex was confined in the same room which his father, Lord Capel,
    had occupied, and in which Lady Essex’s grandfather, the Earl of
    Northumberland, had killed himself in Elizabeth’s reign. To this prison
    Essex was brought in the month of July in the year 1683—a year so fatal
    to some of England’s truest patriots—and there, as has already been
    stated, he was found with his throat cut. Whether Essex died by his own
    hand, or by the hands of others, will never be known. On the whole,
    the evidence points to suicide; and this is the opinion of the most
    trustworthy authorities, such as Green and Gardiner.</p>

  <p>Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex, had been one of the most popular of
    the liberal leaders in the country. He had held high offices in the
    State, he had been Ambassador from the court of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> to that
    of Copenhagen, he had been Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and, for a
    short time, Prime Minister. The only son of the gallant Lord Capel
    of Hadham, who had been executed by Cromwell, Essex had every reason
    to expect some gratitude from the son of the man for whose sake his
    father had given his life. But with the Stuarts the sense of gratitude
    was an unknown quantity, and Essex was doomed to share the fates of
    his friends, Russell and Sidney, accused by the same traitor who had
    betrayed both them and himself. On the day of Essex’s death, the King
    and his brother James had been visiting the Tower, a place in which
    neither of them had set foot for a dozen years. After James’s flight at
    the Revolution, it was eagerly believed that this visit was in some way
    connected with Essex’s death. In a curious contemporary print, Essex is
    seen being murdered by three well-dressed individuals, the position in
    which his body was found after death being also shown at the same time.
    In the depositions alluded to above, the sentry at the prison door
    stated that two men had entered the room <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>on the morning of the
    Earl’s death, that an alarm was given by Essex’s valet when he found
    his master’s body on the floor of the closet next his bedroom with his
    throat cut. Two children deposed that they had seen a hand throwing a
    razor out of the Earl’s window, that a woman then left the house and
    picked it up. A sentry, named Robert Meek, who had made some remarks
    tending to prove that Essex had met with foul play, was found dead soon
    afterwards in the Tower moat.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Bad and heartless as were both the King and his brother James, none
    can believe that they would commit a cold-blooded murder themselves;
    and had they hired others to do so, the fact of the brothers having
    gone that same morning to the fortress gives the idea of murder high
    improbability, and Essex’s death will remain one of the many unsolved
    tragic mysteries of the Tower. That the authorities believed the theory
    of suicide is proved by the register of St Peter’s in the Tower, in
    which is the following entry: “Arthur, Earl of Essex, cutt his own
    throat within the Tower, July 13, 1683. Buried in this Chapel.”</p>

  <p>But to return to Lord Russell. After his condemnation, and during
    the few days that were left to him on earth, Russell was visited by
    Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, as well as by Bishop Burnet, both of
    whom urged him to sign a paper declaring his adherence to the principle
    of non-resistance, which they declared to be an article of Christian
    faith. Russell said, in answer, that he had always believed in the
    right of a nation to defend its religion and liberties when they were
    threatened, expressing his willingness to give up his life in their
    defence; and if he erred in this, “God,” he said, “would forgive him,
    as it would be the sin of ignorance.” He also told the prelates that
    both he and Lady Russell were agreed on this subject, and that nothing
    could alter their views. Lady Russell was fighting in these days to
    save the life she valued far above her own; but all was useless; it
    was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> a hopeless struggle. “I wish,” said Lord Russell, “that my wife
    would give over beating every bush for my preservation”; but he added,
    “if it will be any consolation for her after my death to have done her
    utmost to save me I cannot blame her.”</p>

  <p>On the 19th of July, two days before the day fixed for his execution,
    Russell wrote a letter to the King that was not to be delivered to
    Charles until after the writer’s death. In that letter he assured the
    monarch that “he had always acted for the best interests of the Crown,
    and that if he had been mistaken he hoped the King’s displeasure would
    be satisfied with his death, and would not extend to his widow and
    children.” The following day he received the Blessed Sacrament from
    Tillotson. “Do you believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith
    as taught by the Church of England?” asked the Dean; and Russell
    assenting, “Do you,” continued the Dean, “forgive all your enemies?”
    “With all my heart,” answered Russell. Then after reading and signing
    the paper which he intended to give to the Sheriff on the scaffold—his
    farewell to his country—Russell sent for his wife, who came at once,
    bringing with her their three children. “Stay and sup with me,” he said
    to her, “let us eat our last earthly food together.” At ten o’clock
    that night the parting between these two took place. “Both,” writes
    Burnet, “were silent and trembling, their eyes full of tears which
    did not overflow. When she had left, ‘Now,’ said he, ‘the bitterness
    of death is past.’ Then he broke down: ‘What a blessing she has been
    to me, and what a misery it would have been if she had been crying to
    me to turn informer and to be a Lord Howard.’ And then he praised his
    devoted wife to the good Bishop as she deserved to be praised, for a
    nobler, more loyal or devoted wife than Rachel, Lady Russell, is not to
    be found in all history.”</p>

  <p>Some of the things Russell said to Burnet on that last evening of his
    life are well worth recording. Speaking of death he said, “What a great
    change death made, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> how wonderfully those new scenes would strike
    on a soul.” He had heard, he told Burnet, “how some persons who had
    been born blind were struck when, by the couching of their cataracts,
    they obtained their sight; but what,” said he, “if the first thing they
    saw were the rising sun?”</p>

  <p>Lincoln’s Inn Fields was the place chosen for his execution, the
    scaffold being erected not far from his own house. This was on the 29th
    of July, and when the Sheriffs arrived to take him they found Russell
    quietly winding up his watch. “Now,” he said, “I have done with time,
    and must think henceforward of Eternity.” He then gave the watch as a
    souvenir to Burnet, that good old Bishop of Salisbury who had clung so
    closely to his friend in his trials as to a beloved brother, and to
    whom we owe the touching account of that friend’s last days upon earth.</p>

  <p>On the 7th of December of this same year, Algernon Sidney was executed
    on Tower Hill, having been condemned to death by a picked jury and the
    infamous Chief-Justice Jeffreys, on the trumped-up charge of conspiring
    against the life of Charles; only one witness appeared against him,
    but he was condemned by his writings, which were certainly strongly
    republican; yet, considering what the rule of the second Charles had
    become, a man of Algernon Sidney’s lofty spirit, with his love of
    freedom, could not have written or thought otherwise. It has been well
    said of him that not only did he write from his judgment but also from
    his heart, and he informed his readers of that which he felt as well as
    that which he knew. He was condemned principally for the treatise in
    which he advocated the rights of subjects, under certain contingencies,
    to depose their king, and although this paper had never been published,
    or, in fact, printed, it was sufficient material for Jeffreys, who
    bullied the jury into a committal against Sidney. Algernon Sidney’s
    life had been as noble as was his name, but his unbending republican
    principles had made him the <i lang="fr">bête noire</i> of both Charles and
    James, and any evidence by which he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> be entrapped into a charge
    of treason was welcome to them. When he came forth from the Tower to
    die in the cause of liberty, “Englishmen,” as Dalrymple has finely
    written, “wept not for him as they had done for Lord Russell, their
    pulses beat high, their hearts swelled, they felt an unusual grandeur
    and elevation of mind whilst they looked upon him.” One of the
    Sheriffs asked Sidney if it was his intention to make a speech upon
    the scaffold, to which he answered, “I have made my peace with God,
    and have nothing to say to man,” adding, “I am ready to die, and will
    give you no further trouble.” His last prayers were for “the good old
    cause.” When his head lay on the block, the executioner asked him if he
    would raise it again. “Not till the general resurrection; strike on!”
    And these were Algernon Sidney’s last words. </p>

  <div class="subheadc">JAMES <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> the four years in which James the Second misgoverned England,
    the most interesting events connected with the Tower were the tragedy
    of the Duke of Monmouth’s death, and the imprisonment of the Seven
    Bishops.</p>

  <p>James was the first of our sovereigns to omit passing the night
    previous to his coronation in the Tower, and the fortress now ceased
    entirely to be a royal residence, being given over to the uses which it
    still fulfils.</p>

  <p>After the Duke of Monmouth’s capture near the New Forest, on the 13th
    of July 1685, after his luckless attempt to wrest the Crown from James
    at Sedgemoor, he, with Lord Grey of Wark, was brought to London and
    imprisoned in the Tower, the warrant for his committal being thus
    worded: “James, Duke of Monmouth, 13 July, for High Treason in levying
    war against the King and assuming a title to the Crown.” Monmouth had
    married Lady Anne Scott, daughter of the Earl of Buccleuch, when he
    was only fourteen years of age, but the union does not appear to have
    been a happy one. When the Duchess came to take her last leave of him
    after his condemnation, the interview is said “to have passed with
    decency, but without tokens of affection”; the prisoner’s heart was
    elsewhere. Monmouth had no lack of clergymen to see him pass out of the
    world at the close of his short and wasted life, for during the day and
    night before he died, four ecclesiastics were in attendance upon him,
    and they never left him till the end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> These were Tenison, then Vicar
    of St Martin’s-in-the-Fields, but afterwards Bishop of Lincoln, and
    Primate; Turner, Bishop of Rochester; Hooper, afterwards Bishop of Bath
    and Wells; and the saint-like Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells.
    When Tenison reproached the Duke for the want of feeling he had shown
    towards his wife, Monmouth replied that “his heart was turned against
    her, because in his affliction she had gone to the play and into public
    companies, by which I knew she did not love me.” The woman he loved
    best, and with whom he had been living, was Lady Harriet Wentworth, the
    daughter of Lord Cleveland.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the four clergymen, Monmouth left the Tower on the
    morning of the 15th of July, at ten o’clock; the writ for the delivery
    of the Duke’s body to the Sheriffs is still to be seen in the Record
    Office, being addressed to Sir William Gostling and Sir Peter
    Vanderpatt, and endorsed by them on receiving the Duke from the charge
    of the Lieutenant of the Tower.</p>

  <p>Monmouth passed on foot through a lane of soldiers, preceded by three
    officers, who carried pistols and accompanied him on to the scaffold.
    The Duke’s appearance caused a commotion in the crowd which had come
    to see him die; he had always been a favourite with the people, his
    personal beauty probably being the principal reason for his popularity;
    and he was also regarded as a kind of hero on the Protestant side, as
    opposed to James the Second and the Romish priests. The populace had
    recently given him the title of “King Monmouth.”</p>

  <p>The scaffold was all draped in black. Monmouth made no speech to the
    people, but only conversed with the clergymen near him; but he had
    prepared the following statement, written on a sheet of paper, which
    he gave to one of the Bishops:—“I declare that the title of King was
    forced upon me, and that it was very much contrary to my opinion when I
    was proclaimed. For the satisfaction of the world I do declare that the
    late King told me he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>was never married to my mother. Having declared
    this, I hope that the King who is now, will not let my children
    suffer on this account. And to this I put my hand this 15 July 1685.
    Monmouth.” This extraordinary statement was also signed by the four
    clerics and the two Sheriffs.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Execution of the Duke of Monmouth, July, 1685.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>“Pray do your business well,” Monmouth said to Jack Ketch, the
    headsman. “Do not serve me as you did my Lord Russell. I have heard you
    struck him four or five times; if you strike me twice, I cannot promise
    you not to stir.” Unfortunately poor Monmouth was even worse served by
    the executioner than Russell had been, and it was not until the blows
    had been repeated five times that the once beautiful head was separated
    from the body. Jack Ketch was almost torn to pieces by the horrified
    and furious mob.</p>

  <p>It is almost incredible to believe, did one not know the baseness of
    James’s character, that he had two medals struck in commemoration
    of Monmouth’s execution—“savage medals,” as they were appropriately
    called. “Thus,” writes John Evelyn of Monmouth’s death, “ended this
    quondam Duke, darling of his father, and the ladies, being extremely
    handsome and adroit; an excellent soldier and dancer, a favourite of
    the people, of an easy nature, seduced by knaves, who would have set
    him up only to make a property, and taken the opportunity of the King
    being of another religion, to gather a party of discontented men. He
    failed and perished, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought him
    great riches and a second Dukedom in Scotland.”</p>

  <p>The son of that Marquis of Argyll who had raised the standard of
    rebellion in Scotland in conjunction with Monmouth’s rising in England,
    and who was beheaded in Edinburgh in the same year, was a prisoner in
    the Tower for some weeks. The following is the entry with reference to
    him taken from the Tower records:—“25 June 1685. Archibald Campbell,
    son to the late Marquis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> of Argyll, upon suspicion of dangerous
    practices to the State. Signed by his Majesty’s command. Sunderland.”
    The young man was, however, discharged on the 19th of the following
    October. After his liberation he went to Holland, returning to England
    with William <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, when he was created first Duke of Argyll.</p>

  <p>The Stuarts had solemnly vowed to rule England in the Reformed
    and Protestant faith, but within a quarter of a century of their
    restoration, the Church of Rome had not only been allowed by them to
    recover many of its privileges, but Roman Catholicism had become the
    religion of the King and court. James had set aside the Test Act, a
    measure passed by Parliament in 1663, which required every individual
    in the civil and military employment of the State to take the oath
    of supremacy and allegiance, to declare against the doctrine of
    transubstantiation, and to declare in favour of the doctrine of the
    Sacrament as taught by the Church of England. By annulling this act
    James re-admitted Roman Catholics to any office in the country, both
    in civil and military situations. Four Roman Catholic peers were added
    to the Privy Council; priests and Jesuits flocked into the country
    in great numbers, and Mass was publicly celebrated in the Chapel
    Royal. London again saw the almost forgotten costumes of the different
    religious orders, the brown-robed Franciscans, and the white-robed
    Carmelites, whilst the Jesuit priests opened a school at the Savoy. At
    the same time the King added largely to the standing army, and a camp
    of thirteen thousand men was established at Hounslow, destined, if
    James thought necessary, to keep the capital in check. Whilst James was
    thus trying to coerce his subjects to the Roman Catholic religion, the
    Protestants across the Channel were being persecuted by Louis; for by
    a strange coincidence—if not by a prearranged plan—the same year that
    saw the violation of the Test Act in England, witnessed the revocation
    of the Edict of Nantes in France, with the result that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>thousands of
    French reformers were driven from their homes and crossed to England—a
    living proof of the curse that a bigoted and arbitrary ruler could be
    to his subjects.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_084">

    <div class="caption"><span class="small"><i>Contemporary Portraits of</i></span><br />
      <i>The Duke of Monmouth &amp; others.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>In the succeeding year, 1686, James attempted to gag the English
    Church. The King had appointed two Roman Catholic priests to high
    preferments—Massey to the Deanery of Christ Church, and Parker to
    the See of Oxford; and when the English clergy protested from their
    pulpits against these appointments, James summoned an Ecclesiastical
    Commission, at the head of which he placed Jeffreys. The first action
    of this Commission was to suspend Compton, Bishop of London, who had
    refused to suspend the Dean of Norwich (Sharpe), one of the offending
    preachers against the Papist appointments made by the King.</p>

  <p>In 1687 Oxford had the high honour of bringing about the Revolution,
    which saved England from a fresh tyranny and led to the final overthrow
    of the Stuart princes.</p>

  <p>James intended to place a Roman Catholic, of the name of Farmer, over
    the Fellows at Magdalen College; but the College, instead of accepting
    this nominee of the King, chose one of their number, Hough, for their
    head. Whereupon, the Ecclesiastical Court, with Jeffreys at its head,
    declared the Magdalen election null and void, and Parker, the Bishop
    of Oxford, James’s nominee to that see, was forced upon Magdalen as
    its President. Parker died in 1688, and James again appointed a Roman
    Catholic bishop <i lang="la">in partibus</i>, Bonaventure Giffard, to take his
    place. Previously, the King had visited Oxford, and after abusing the
    Fellows for their independence, had expelled five-and-twenty of them.
    These arbitrary measures led to a clerical revolt throughout England.
    In the April of the following year, James issued a form of indulgence,
    which he ordered to be read in all the churches. By this form the King
    hoped to unite the Roman Catholics with the Protestant Nonconformists
    under the banner of “liberty of conscience”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> against the Church, and
    thus make the Church herself assist in her own defeat by the use of his
    ecclesiastical supremacy (Wakeman’s “History of the Church of England”).</p>

  <p>The clergy protested, and six bishops, with Sancroft, the Archbishop of
    Canterbury, at their head, drew up a petition to the King, protesting
    against the form. The petition was most humble; it stated that the
    petitioners considered this Declaration of Indulgence to religious
    dissenters to be founded “upon such a dispensing power as hath often
    been declared illegal by Parliament, and particularly in the years
    1662 and 1672, and in the beginning of your Majesty’s reign; and in a
    matter of so great moment and consequence to the whole nation, both in
    Church and State, your petitioners cannot, in providence, honour, or
    conscience, so far make themselves parties to it as the distributors of
    it all over the nation, and the solemn publication of it once again,
    even in God’s House, and in the time of Divine Service, must amount to
    in common and reasonable contention.”</p>

  <p>The King read the petition, scowled, and returned it to Sancroft,
    saying angrily: “I did not expect this from the Church of England!”
    adding, “If I change my mind you shall hear from me; if not, I shall
    expect my commands shall be obeyed.”</p>

  <p>Three weeks afterwards the Bishops and the Archbishop were summoned to
    appear before the Privy Council. Jeffreys insolently inquired whether
    they were ready to give recognisances to be tried for misdemeanours
    before the Court of the King’s Bench, and waiving their plea of being
    Peers of Parliament, he refused the prelates bail, and had them
    committed to the Tower. In order to avoid the demonstration in the
    Bishops’ favour, which both James and Jeffreys dreaded if they were
    taken through the streets of the city, they were conveyed to the Tower
    in the royal barge along the river. But their passage to the fortress
    was one long ovation, and as the barge approached the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>Tower, numbers
    of people rushed knee-deep into the water to receive the blessing of
    the prelates, and, on their arrival, even the warders received them
    kneeling at the landing-place.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Seven Bishops.</i><br />
      <span class="small"><i>(From a Contemporary Print.)</i></span></div>
  </div>

  <p>As the Seven Bishops passed under St Thomas’s Tower, and landed at
    the Traitor’s Gate, the bells of St Peter’s Chapel were ringing for
    evening service. Passing over the green, they entered the chapel and
    attended the service. The appropriateness of the second lesson struck
    all who were present, being a chapter in the 2nd of Corinthians—“Giving
    no offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed: but in all
    things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience,
    in afflictions, in distresses, in imprisonments.”</p>

  <p>A most uncomfortable week must have been passed by these Reverend
    Fathers of the Church in the Tower, for they were all crowded together
    in the by no means spacious Martin Tower. On the 15th of June they
    were taken from the Tower to the bar of the Court of King’s Bench—on
    this occasion they were admitted to bail. Their trial began a
    fortnight later, taking place in Westminster Hall, and was one of the
    most memorable of the great historic events that that building has
    witnessed. When the verdict of “Not guilty” was pronounced, the old oak
    roof of William Rufus’s hall re-echoed with the shouts of the people
    gathered below; it was a moment, as Wakeman has eloquently written in
    his “History of the Church of England,” “unparalleled in the history of
    English courts of law. The crowd within and without Westminster Hall
    broke into a frenzy of enthusiastic joy. Men fell upon each other’s
    necks, and wept and shouted and laughed and wept again; and amid the
    cheers of men and the boom of cannon the heroes of the Church passed in
    safety to their homes.”</p>

  <p>The names of these seven “humble heroes” who had so nobly stood up in
    defence of the rights of the Church of England and of the liberty of
    their land, were Sancroft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> the Primate; Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath
    and Wells; William Lloyd, Bishop of St Asaph’s; John Lake, Bishop of
    Chichester; Thomas White, Bishop of Peterborough; Jonathan Trelawney,
    Bishop of Bristol; and Francis Turner, Bishop of Ely. Sancroft had been
    promoted from the Deanery of St Paul’s to Canterbury after the death of
    Archbishop Sheldon, and had helped much in the rebuilding of St Paul’s.
    He left a fine library to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he had
    been master. Thomas Ken was famous for his unaffected piety, and the
    beautiful hymn he composed. Lloyd helped Bishop Burnet to write his
    “History of the Reformation.” Lake had fought in the army of Charles
    I., and had been Bishop of Man and Bishop of Bristol, before occupying
    the See of Chichester; Trelawney was successively Bishop of Bristol,
    Exeter, and Winchester; and Francis Turner had been Dean of Winchester,
    a position he had held, together with the Bishopric of Rochester,
    before being preferred to Ely.</p>

  <p>Compared with these men the State prisoners in the Tower in the reign
    of James <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> were not of much interest. After Monmouth’s rebellion,
    Lord Stamford, with Lord Delamere and Charles Gerrard, “commonly called
    Lord Bandon,” were prisoners in the fortress. Sir Robert Cotton and
    John Crewe Offleigh were in the Tower charged with “dangerous and
    treasonable practices,” and also Mr J. Cook, a member of the House of
    Commons, “for his indecent and undutiful speech, reflecting on the King
    and the House of Commons.”</p>

  <p>A strange case was that of Sir Bevil Skelton, who was a prisoner in
    September 1688, and “who had been recalled from France for exceeding
    his instructions in certain political transactions,” for not only
    was he speedily released, but was made Governor of the Tower, an
    appointment which caused much dissatisfaction. This appointment was the
    last of James’s unpopular acts, and when, three months later, the King
    fled the country, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>House of Lords removed Skelton from his post,
    and gave the keys of the Tower into the custody of Lord Lucas.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Seven Bishops going by Water to the Tower.</i></div>

  <p>On the 11th of December 1688, James left Whitehall, a King without a
    crown, and as he crossed the Thames to reach Lambeth, he dropped the
    Great Seal into the river, hoping thereby that everything would fall
    into confusion for the want of that symbol of legitimate authority.
    The curious Dutch engraving representing the amiable act of the last
    of our male Stuart monarchs gives a view of old London Bridge, and
    the Tower beyond, looming large against a wintry sky. On the same day
    that James threw away the Great Seal of England, his Lord Chancellor,
    the justly detested Jeffreys, was taken, in the disguise of a common
    sailor, in a small house at Wapping, as he was about to go on board a
    collier which would have taken him to Hamburg. Once in the power of
    the mob, Jeffreys’ life was in deadly peril, and he suffered severely
    at the hands of the people, but was finally rescued and taken before
    the Lord Mayor, who, poor man, died in a fit soon after the terrible
    judge had been brought before him, more revolting in his abject terror
    of death than even during the Bloody Assizes in the West, when he had
    condemned shoals of men and women to tortures and death with jibes and
    ghastly pleasantry. Protected by two regiments of the City train-bands,
    Jeffreys was taken into the Tower on the 12th of December, and given
    in charge of Lord Lucas, the Governor. The warrant of Jeffreys’
    arrest, which is unique, is among the Tower records, and runs as
    follows:—“We, the peers of this Realm, being assembled with some of
    the Privy Council, do hereby will and require you to take into your
    custody the body of George, Lord Jeffreys (herewith sent to you), and
    to keep him safe prisoner until further order; for which this shall be
    your sufficient warrant.” This warrant is signed by thirteen peers,
    including the Bishop of Winchester.</p>

  <p>James having fled, and the Great Seal being at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> bottom of the
    Thames, there was no King or Parliament existing at the time the
    warrant was made out. Jeffreys was half dead with terror when the
    coach in which he was taken to the Tower entered its gates. All the
    way from the Mansion House he had implored the soldiers about him to
    preserve him from the furious rabble that surged around the carriage
    with ferocious cries of a well-merited hatred. This brute, who had
    sent scores of innocent people to the block and the gallows, who had
    rejoiced, like the fiend he was, at the sufferings of his victims as
    they left his presence for the gibbet, or the plantations, to be sold
    as slaves, now attempted to excite pity for himself amongst those
    persons who came to see him in the Tower, by telling them that he had
    only acted as he had done by the orders of King James, and that James
    had chidden him for showing too much clemency.</p>

  <p>Jeffreys was only forty years old when he was taken to the Tower, but
    he soon wasted away, tormented, one might imagine, by the spectres of
    those whom he had destroyed, and of the thousands whom he had made
    desolate. Whether he died from drinking brandy to excess or not, is of
    little moment, but according to Oldnixon, his body “continued to decay”
    until the 19th of April 1689, when he died at the age of forty-one.
    He had been Chief-Justice at thirty-five, and Lord Chancellor at
    thirty-seven. No one looking at his portrait in the National Portrait
    Gallery would imagine that the melancholy-looking and distinguished
    young man, with his long, flowing wig, could be the most cruel,
    vindictive, and unmerciful judge with whom the English Bench has ever
    been cursed.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">WILLIAM AND MARY</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Only</span> one prisoner of State suffered death during the twelve years of
    the joint reigns of William of Orange and Mary. This was Sir John
    Fenwick, who had been implicated in a plot to assassinate William, and
    being found guilty of high treason, was beheaded on Tower Hill on 28th
    January 1697.</p>

  <p>There were, however, a number of more or less unfortunate important
    State prisoners at different times in the fortress, the most
    interesting of these being the future Duke of Marlborough, for
    “abetting and adhering to their Majesties’ enemies.” In Lord Wolseley’s
    admirable history of that great soldier’s life, we read under the date
    of 5th May 1697: “Marlborough was kept a close prisoner in the Tower,
    no one being allowed to see him except by order of the Secretary of
    State. His wife left the Princess Anne at Sion House in order to be
    near him in town, and she left no means untried to obtain his release.
    There still exist many orders signed by Lord Nottingham granting her
    permission to see him in prison, the earliest being dated five days
    after his committal, and worded ‘for this time only.’ A Mr Chudleigh
    was a frequent visitor; the first order of admission given him was to
    see Marlborough in presence of a warder, ‘for this time only.’ Later
    on, we find an order addressed to Lord Lucas, the Constable of the
    Tower, signifying the Queen’s pleasure that friends and relatives of
    the prisoners lately committed should have access to them from time
    to time. They were subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> allowed to dine together, when all
    dread of invasion had passed away. Marlborough, in the Tower, had
    fewer friends than ever, but his wife makes honourable mention of Lord
    Bradford, who not only refused to sign the warrant which committed
    him to prison, but paid him a visit when there.... Writing to Lady
    Marlborough, Princess Anne says: ‘I hear Lord Marlborough is sent to
    the Tower, and though I am certain they have nothing against him, and
    expected by your letter it would be so, yet I was struck when I was
    told of it, for methinks it is a dismal thing to have one’s friends
    sent to that place.’... ‘At length, on June 15, Marlborough was brought
    before the Court of King’s Bench on a writ of habeas corpus, and
    released from the Tower upon finding bail for £6000 for his appearance
    when required.’” (“Life of Marlborough,” vol. ii.)</p>

  <p>The same charge of “abetting and adhering to their Majesties’ enemies,”
    upon which Marlborough had been imprisoned, was brought against Lord
    Brudenell, the Earl of Huntingdon, Sir Robert Thorold, and Colonel
    Langston.</p>

  <p>In the same year the ruffianly head of the gang of “Mohawks,” Lord
    Mohun, who figures in Thackeray’s “Esmond,” was twice in the Tower
    for having committed two assassinations—the first, that of the actor
    William Mountford, whom Mohun had murdered in a quarrel over the
    celebrated actress, Mrs Bracegirdle; and the second, when, with Edward,
    Earl of Warwick, he had helped to kill one Richard Coate. In 1695, Sir
    Basil Firebrace was in the Tower, as well as the Earls of Salisbury,
    Peterborough, and Arran, with Lord Montgomery, all imprisoned on the
    charge of being concerned in Jacobite plots. With these were Sir
    Edward Hale, Sir Thomas Jenner, Lord Castlemaine, Lord Forbes, Colonel
    Lumley, Captain Shackerley, Lord Preston, Sir Richard Cleaver, Sir
    Robert Hamilton, and Edward Griffin, upon whom James conferred a barony
    whilst he was imprisoned in the Tower, a title James had no more right
    to bestow than Griffin had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>to receive. Griffin, it seems, owed his
    imprisonment to an accident. He was in active correspondence with the
    court at St Germains, and had ordered a large pewter bottle to be
    made with a false bottom, in which to conceal letters. Late one night
    he gave this bottle to his cook with directions to have it soldered.
    Whilst this was being done, a packet of letters was discovered in the
    false bottom directed to James <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The cook was immediately seized, and
    Griffin, with his wife, was sent to the Tower, whence, however, he made
    his escape, but soon afterwards surrendered himself to the authorities.
    He died in the Tower in 1710.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>View of the Tower in the time of James <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The affection and loyalty inspired by the Stuarts brought many
    prisoners to the Tower, refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the
    joint sovereigns being answered by the authorities with confinement
    in the fortress, on the charge of “abetting and adhering to their
    Majesties’ enemies.” Of these, Francis Cholmondeley, Lord Yarmouth,
    and some others, were there in 1690, the names of Lords Newburgh,
    Clancarty, Tyrone, Morley, Monteagle, Dartmouth, Cahir, the Earl of
    Clarendon, Major-General Dorrington, and General Maxwell, also figure
    on the list, but against these no specific charge is now apparent. Two
    years afterwards a Mr Henry Grey, a member of the House of Commons, was
    there, accused of taking bribes, as well as Lord Falkland; and the Earl
    of Torrington’s defeat by the French fleet off Beachy Head was punished
    by an enforced residence in the State prison.</p>

  <p>That the fortress was crowded with prisoners towards the close of
    William’s reign is apparent by two papers which, by the kindness of Mr
    Birch, the Curator of the Soane Museum, I have been allowed to copy
    here, but it must be added that out of all the State prisoners in the
    Tower under William’s rule only one suffered the extreme penalty of the
    law. The papers are as follows:—</p>

  <div class="subheadc">QUEEN ANNE</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Few</span> prisoners of any degree were committed to the Tower during the
    reign of Anne, except during the first year of her rule, when the
    Continental wars brought some French prisoners of war, who were
    confined there. In 1712, however, the famous Sir Robert Walpole
    was committed to the Tower “for high breach of trust and notorious
    corruption.” Walpole’s committal was entirely due to political
    intrigue, and his disgrace and imprisonment closely resembled that
    of the Duke of Choiseul in the reign of Louis <abbr title="16th">XVI.</abbr>, when half of the
    French society of the day flocked to the fallen Minister’s house
    at Chanteloup. Walpole’s apartment in the Tower was crowded all
    day long with a succession of smart folk, among whom the Duke and
    Duchess of Marlborough, with whom the Queen had broken off her former
    great intimacy, were conspicuous; Godolphin, Somers, Sunderland, and
    Pulteney, Earl of Bath, were also frequent visitors.</p>

  <p>Three years after Walpole had left his rooms in the Tower they were
    occupied by George Granville, Earl of Lansdowne—a nobleman of strong
    Jacobite proclivities. He was a poet as well as a Jacobite, and finding
    Walpole’s name written on the window of the room, he wrote beneath it
    the following distich:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Good unexpected, evil unforeseen,</div>
        <div class="i1">Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene;</div>
        <div class="i1">Some, raised aloft, come tumbling down amain,</div>
        <div class="i1">And fall so hard, they bound and rise again.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>
  <p>It may be interesting at this place to recall some of the incidents
    connected with the Mint in the Tower.</p>

  <p>Few persons on reading the name of John Rotier, which is placed on the
    commemoration brass tablet in the Chapel of St Peter’s in the Tower
    bearing the names of the illustrious dead there buried, would probably
    have an idea of his claims to distinction. So little artistic interest
    is connected with the old fortress that Rotier’s name deserves more
    than a passing mention.</p>

  <p>John Rotier, or Roettier, belonged to a family of medallists, and was
    the son of an Antwerp jeweller who had been of considerable assistance
    to Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> during his exile. Rotier came over to England soon
    after Charles returned, and, on the recommendation of the King, was
    received into the Mint under Simon the chief medallist. In the year
    1662, Rotier, with his two brothers, became the King’s medallist, with
    quarters in the Tower. Pepys often came to see the three brothers at
    work, and was much interested in 1667, when Rotier was engaged in
    making a new medal for Charles, in which the figure of Britannia was
    being taken from the beautiful face and form of Miss Stuart, one of
    Charles’s mistresses, and afterwards Duchess of Richmond; this is the
    same figure, with a little alteration, that appears on our copper pence
    at the present day. Rotier had also made a Great Seal for Charles, and
    on the accession of James he made that monarch’s coronation medal.</p>

  <p>The King’s profile appears on the obverse of this medal, and on the
    reverse is a trophy of armour, with ships in the background, and
    the words “Genus Antu Antiquum” engraved above. It appears to be an
    excellent likeness, the determined lines of obstinacy and self-will
    which marked James’s face being admirably rendered. When William came
    to the throne of his father-in-law Rotier fell into disgrace, being
    supposed to be a Jacobite, a not unnatural supposition, seeing his
    connection with both James and Charles. But what was more alarming
    than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>any supposition of Jacobite sympathies was a rumour that the
    exiled King had returned, and was lying concealed in Rotier’s lodgings:
    he was promptly accused of stealing some dies from the Mint, and of
    striking coins for the service of James.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_096">
    <div class="caption"><i>THE SOUTH-EAST PROSPECT OF THE CHAPEL ROYAL OF S<sup>T</sup>.
      PETER IN THE TOWER.</i></div>
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>A Committee of the House of Commons sat on the poor medallist, its
    decision being that “It is too great a trust and may be of dangerous
    consequence for the said Roettier to have the custody of the dies, he
    being a Roman Catholic and keeping an Irish Papist in his house, and
    having the custody of the said dies, it lies in his power to let them
    out when he pleases, or to coin false money in the Tower. That the Lord
    Lucas has complained that the Tower is not safe while so many Papists
    are entertained in Roettier’s house.” All Roetier’s dies and puncheons
    were accordingly seized, and he himself was driven from the Tower.
    He appears to have returned, however, in 1703, just after a visit he
    had received from Sir Godfrey Kneller, who had been sent to him by
    Queen Anne to execute a medal of her Majesty, which, however, the old
    medallist was unable to perform; he died shortly afterwards, and was
    buried in St Peter’s Chapel.</p>

  <p>In an interesting article by Mr W. J. Hocking in the <cite>Gentleman’s
     Magazine</cite> for March 1895, entitled “Money-making in the Tower,”
    there is some curious information respecting the Mint once established
    in the Tower. Mr Hocking says that coining operations have been carried
    on in the Tower in every reign since the Conquest, save in those of
    Richard I. and Edward V. It is even possible that the Romans struck
    their money in the Tower, for Constantine had a mint working in London,
    the treasurer of which bore the title of Praepositus Thesaurorum
    Augustinium. In Edward the Third’s reign it was enacted that all
    moneys, wherever coined, should be made in the same manner as in the
    Tower. James I. was present at the trial of the Pix in the Tower,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> and
    “diligently viewed the state of his money and mint.”</p>

  <p>Money was coined in fifteen places at least, besides the Tower, in the
    reign of Charles I. It was during his tenure of the crown that Nicholas
    Briot, a French engraver, worked at the Tower, the money then turned
    out being said to be the finest in the world.</p>

  <p>After the Restoration small steel rolling-mills were set up in the
    Tower driven by horse and water power, the cost of striking one year’s
    coinage being £1400. The new milled coinage was a great improvement
    on the old hammered coins. It was at this time that the great English
    medallist Simon’s “Petition Medal” was produced. This came from a
    competition, between him and Roetier; the latter won the competition,
    and consequently made the puncheons and dies for the new coinage. Simon
    was infuriated by his defeat and spoke some hasty words which, being
    repeated to Charles, caused his dismissal. Some twenty of Simon’s
    “petition medals” were struck, with the legend round their edges as
    follows:—“Thomas Simon most humbly prays your Majesty to compare this
    his tryall piece with the Dutch (Roetier’s), and if more truly drawn
    and embossed, more gracefully order’d and more accurately engraven, to
    relieve him.” For one of these medals as much as £500 has been given by
    a firm of London coin-dealers, so rare is the piece.</p>

  <p>The punishment meted out to coiners and clippers of coins in this
    reign was incredibly barbarous. In those so-called “good old times”
    in one day seven men were hanged and a woman burned for clipping and
    counterfeiting the current coin.</p>

  <p>A Coinage Act was passed by Parliament in 1696, and under its
    provisions all the old hammered money was called in, melted in furnaces
    near Whitehall, and sent in ingots to the Tower, to reappear in the
    new milled form. That wonderful man, Sir Isaac Newton, was made Master
    of the Tower Mint, and the number of mills being increased <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>by
    his advice, in a few months, owing to his energy, a time of great
    commercial prosperity ensued. In 1810 the new Office of the Mint was
    opened on Little Tower Hill, where it still remains.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Beauchamp Tower</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The following is taken from Mr Hocking’s article on the Tower Mint:—</p>

  <p>“On the morning of December 20th, 1798, James Turnbull, one Dalton,
    and two other men were engaged in the press-room swinging the fly of
    the screw-press, while Mr Finch, one of the manager’s apprentices, fed
    the press with gold blank pieces, which were struck into guineas. At
    nine o’clock Mr Finch sent the men to their breakfast. They all four
    went out; but Dalton and Turnbull returned almost directly. And while
    the latter held the door, Turnbull drew a pistol and advanced upon Mr
    Finch, demanding the key of the closet where the newly-coined guineas
    were kept. Finch, paralyzed with fear and surprise, yielded it up. An
    old gentleman who was in the room expostulated; but both were forced
    into a sort of passage or large cupboard and locked in. Turnbull then
    helped himself to the guineas, and managed to get off with no less
    than 2308. For nine days he effectually concealed himself in the
    neighbourhood, and then, while endeavouring to escape to France, was
    apprehended. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. In his
    defence he cleared Dalton from any willing complicity in the crime.”
    Turnbull was executed at the Old Bailey.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">GEORGE <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">With</span> George the First the Whigs came into power, and soon after the new
    King’s accession, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, and the former Lord
    Treasurer, was sent to the Tower on the charge of having advised the
    French King as to the best means for capturing the town of Tournai.
    Harley had resigned his Treasurer’s staff three days before Queen
    Anne’s death, and on the 10th of June 1715, he was impeached by the
    Commons, of whom only a short time before he had been the idol, and
    committed to the Tower. His courage never wavered, although he was
    left to languish for two years in the fortress, and at length, on
    petitioning to be tried, he was acquitted in July 1717. He died seven
    years later, aged sixty-two. Lord Powis and Sir William Wyndham soon
    followed Lord Oxford to the Tower, but the latter was very shortly
    after set at liberty without even undergoing a trial. Wyndham was
    member for the county of Somerset from 1708 until his death in 1740; he
    had been Secretary of State for War and Chancellor of the Exchequer to
    Queen Anne, as well as Master of the Buckhounds. His talents and his
    eloquence made him one of the foremost men of that brilliant age, and
    Pope sang his praises:</p>

        <div class="i1">The Master of his passions and our own?”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Another distinguished prisoner at this time in the Tower <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>was George
    Granville, Lord Lansdowne of Bideford. Descended from that race of
    heroes, the Grenvilles of the West, of whom Admiral Sir Richard of
    the <cite>Revenge</cite> was the most famous, and grandson of Sir Bevil
    Grenville, killed at the Battle of Lansdowne, George Granville belonged
    by race and conviction to the party of the Stuarts, and, too proud to
    seek safety in flight, as did so many of his contemporaries at the
    accession of the House of Hanover, he remained in England, and even
    protested from his place in the House of Lords against the Bill for
    attainting Ormonde and Bolingbroke. Strongly suspected of favouring
    the cause of James Stuart, Lansdowne was accused of having taken part
    in a plot for raising an insurrection in the West Country, where his
    name was a pillar of strength, “being possessed,” as Lord Bolingbroke
    said, “now with the same political phrenzy for the Pretender as he had
    in his youth for his father.” The plot was discovered, and at the close
    of September 1715, Lansdowne and his wife were committed to the Tower
    and kept there in close confinement until all danger of insurrection
    had passed away, and until the rising in the North had been crushed. In
    Queen Anne’s time, Lansdowne had been sung as</p>

  <p>In 1710 he had succeeded Walpole as Minister for War, but he prided
    himself more upon his literary gifts than upon those of his birth and
    rank, or upon his political eminence. He wrote poetry, sad stuff, and
    plays which were worse than his poems, for in these he out-Wycherlyed
    Wycherley. The plays of the days of the Restoration not excepted, there
    is nothing more indecent in theatrical literature than Granville’s “The
    Old Gallant.”</p>

  <p>The famous rising in Scotland in 1715 in favour of the son of James
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, the Chevalier de St George, or, as his adherents called him,
    James the Third, brought many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> the leaders of that ill-starred
    rebellion to the Tower, and some to the block. Of the latter the
    young Earl of Derwentwater was the most conspicuous. James Radcliffe,
    Lord Derwentwater, was the only Englishman of high birth who took up
    arms for the Jacobite cause in this rebellion of 1715. He appears to
    have been a youth of high merit, and was only twenty-six when he was
    persuaded to throw life and fortune on the side of the Chevalier. One
    who knew him writes “that he was a man formed by nature to be generally
    beloved.” His connection with the Stuarts was possibly brought about by
    the fact that his mother, Mary Tudor, was a natural daughter of Charles
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and also that he was a Catholic by birth. He was a very wealthy
    landowner, with vast estates, which, after his execution, were given to
    Greenwich Hospital. They brought him in, including the mines, between
    thirty and forty thousand pounds a year, a great fortune in those days.
    His home, from which he derived his title, was situated in the most
    beautiful of the English lakes, the lovely Lake of Derwentwater in
    Cumberland, and was called Lord’s Island.</p>

  <p>Derwentwater had been taken prisoner at Preston, with six Scotch
    noblemen, William Maxwell, Earl of Nithsdale, Robert Dalziel, Earl
    of Carnwath, George Seton, Lord Wintoun, William Gordon, Lord
    Kenmure, William Murray, Earl of Nairn, and William Widdrington, Lord
    Widdrington. They were brought up to London with their arms tied behind
    them, their horses led by soldiers, and preceded by drums and music, in
    a kind of trumpery triumph, and imprisoned in the Tower. Much interest
    was made on their behalf in both Houses of Parliament; in the Commons,
    Richard Steele pleaded for them, and in the Lords, a motion for reading
    the petition presented to both Houses, praying the King to show mercy
    to the prisoners, had only been carried against the Ministry by a
    majority of nine. An address was presented to George the First, praying
    him to “reprieve such of the condemned <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>lords as deserved mercy.” To
    this petition George, or rather, his Prime Minister, Robert Walpole,
    answered that the King would act as he thought most consistent for
    the dignity of the Crown and the safety of the people, thus virtually
    rejecting the address. Many of those who had places in the Government
    and had voted against the Ministry were dismissed from their offices.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The trial of the Jacobite lords commenced on the 9th of February, and
    lasted ten days. Wintoun, the only one of the prisoners who pleaded
    “not guilty,” was the only one pardoned; the others were condemned to
    death, Lord Cowper, the Lord High Steward, pronouncing sentence on the
    29th of February as follows:—“And now, my Lords, nothing remains but
    that I pronounce upon you, and sorry I am that it falls to my lot to
    do it, that terrible sentence of the law, which must be the same that
    is usually given against the meanest offenders in the like kind. The
    most ignominious and painful parts of it are usually remitted by the
    grace of the Crown, to persons of your quality; but the law in this
    case being deaf to all distinction of persons, requires that I should
    pronounce, and accordingly it is adjudged by this Court, ‘That you,
    James, Earl of Derwentwater, William, Lord Widdrington, William, Earl
    of Nithsdale, Robert, Earl of Carnwath, William, Viscount Kenmure, and
    William, Lord Nairne, and every of you, return to the prison of the
    Tower, from whence you came, and thence you must be drawn to the place
    of execution; when you come there, you must be hang’d by the neck, but
    not till you be dead; for you must be cut down alive; then your bowels
    must be taken out, and burnt before your face; then your heads must
    be severed from your bodies, and your bodies divided each into four
    quarters; and these must be at the King’s disposal. And God Almighty be
    merciful to your souls!’”</p>

  <p>Widdrington and Carnwath were released by the Act of Grace in 1717,
    and Lord Nairne was subsequently pardoned, the four remaining noblemen
    being left to die.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

  <p>At ten o’clock in the morning of the 24th of February, Derwentwater
    and Kenmure were brought out of the Tower in a coach and were driven
    to a house known as the Transport Office, on Tower Hill, facing the
    scaffold, which was draped in black cloth; there they remained whilst
    the final preparations for their execution were being carried out.</p>

  <p>The first to be led out was young Lord Derwentwater; as he mounted the
    scaffold steps his face was seen to be blanched, but beyond this he
    showed no other sign of emotion in that supreme moment, and when he
    spoke to the people it was with a firm voice and a composed manner.
    After praying for some time he rose from his knees and read a paper
    in which he declared himself a faithful subject of the Chevalier St
    George, whom he said he regarded as his rightful King. There was some
    roughness upon the surface of the block, which Derwentwater perceiving,
    he bade the executioner plane it smooth with the axe. He then took off
    his coat and waistcoat, telling the headsman to look afterwards in the
    pockets, where he should find some money for himself to pay him for
    his trouble, adding that the signal for the blow would be when for the
    third time he repeated the words, “Lord Jesus, receive my soul,” by
    stretching out his arms. He was killed at one stroke. Thus perished in
    his twenty-eighth year a man who was loved by all who knew him, rich
    and poor, and whose memory still lingers in his beautiful northern lake
    country in many an old song and ballad.</p>

  <p>There is a curious legend connected with Derwentwater’s death to
    the effect that after his execution, the peasantry rose and drove
    Lady Derwentwater from Lord’s Island, believing that it was at her
    instigation that her husband had joined the Jacobite rising; a ravine
    near their old home, through which Lady Derwentwater is supposed to
    have fled, still goes by the name of the “Lady’s Rake.” On the night
    of his execution a brilliant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>“aurora borealis” lighted the northern
    skies of Derwentwater, which the people in that district interpreted
    as being a signal of Heaven’s displeasure at the death of the popular
    young Earl; and the aurora is still called in the North, “Lord
    Derwentwater’s Lights.”</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_104">
    <img class="illowp83" src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Earl of Derwentwater.</i><br />
      <span class="small">(<i>From a Contemporary Engraving.</i>)</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>After the scaffold had been cleaned, and every mark of the first
    execution removed, Lord Kenmure was brought out from the house in
    which he had waited whilst Derwentwater was being put to death, and
    came on the scaffold accompanied by his son, two clergymen, and some
    other friends. Kenmure, unlike Derwentwater, belonged to the Church of
    England. He made no formal speech, but expressed his sorrow at having
    pleaded guilty. He told the executioner that he should give him no
    signal, but that he was to strike the second time he placed his head
    upon the block. It required two blows of the axe to kill him.</p>

  <p>Kenmure had married the sister of Robert, Earl of Carnwath, who was
    one of his fellow-prisoners, but who was respited and pardoned. By
    judicious management, Lady Kenmure was able to save a remnant out of
    the forfeited estates of her husband, and, later on, George the First
    returned part of the family estates to her and her children.</p>

  <p>Some of the crowd who had gone to Tower Hill that morning in the
    hope of seeing three of the Jacobite lords beheaded, must have
    been surprised when only two appeared; the third doomed man, Lord
    Nithsdale, had made his escape from the Tower a few hours before his
    fellow-captives were led out to die.</p>

  <p>Lord Nithsdale’s escape on the eve of his execution reads more like
    a romance than sober history. But it was his wife who made the name
    famous for all time by her devotion and undaunted courage. All hope
    seemed lost after the Address for Mercy had been rejected by the King,
    and all idea of respite had indeed been abandoned except by the brave
    Lady Nithsdale, who was the daughter of William, Marquis of Powis, and
    was born about the year 1690. On hearing of the capture of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> husband
    at Preston, Lady Nithsdale had ridden up to London from their home,
    Torreglas, in Dumfriesshire, through the bitter winter weather, and,
    although not a strong woman, had endured all the hardships of the long
    journey and the anguish of anxiety regarding her husband, with heroic courage.</p>

  <p>Before leaving Torreglas she had buried all the most important family
    records in the garden. Accompanied by her faithful Welsh maid, Evans,
    and a groom, she rode to Newcastle, and thence by public stage to York,
    where the snow lay so thick that no mail-coach could leave the city for
    the south. Nothing daunted, Lady Nithsdale rode all the way to London.
    On her arrival in the capital, her first object was to intercede
    for her husband with the King. She went to St James’s Palace, where
    George was holding a drawing-room, and sat waiting for him in the long
    corridor on the first floor, through which the King would pass after
    leaving his room before entering the state rooms. Lady Nithsdale had
    never seen George the First, and in order to make no mistake, she had
    brought a friend, a Mrs Morgan, who knew the King by sight. When George
    appeared, “I threw myself,” Lady Nithsdale writes, “at his feet, and
    told him in French that I was the unfortunate Countess of Nithsdale,
    that he might not pretend to be ignorant of my person. But seeing that
    he wanted to go off without taking my petition, I caught hold of the
    skirt of his coat, that he might stop and hear me. He endeavoured to
    escape out of my hands, but I kept such strong hold, that he dragged
    me on my knees, from the middle of the room to the very door of the
    drawing-room. At last one of the Blue Ribands who attended his Majesty
    took me round the waist, while another wrested the coat from my hands.
    The petition, which I had endeavoured to thrust into his pocket, fell
    to the ground in the scuffle, and I almost fainted away from grief and
    disappointment.”</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost, and after this last chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> of obtaining
    a hearing from King George had failed, Lady Nithsdale knew that she,
    and she alone, could save her husband’s life. To this almost hopeless
    task she now devoted all her mind and all her courage.</p>

  <p>Returning to the Tower, where she had already been on several
    occasions, she pretended to be the bearer of good news. On this
    occasion she only remained long enough to tell Lord Nithsdale the
    plan she had formed for effecting his deliverance, after which she
    returned to her lodgings in Drury Lane. There she confided her plan
    to her landlady, a worthy soul, named Mills, and prevailed upon her
    to accompany her to the Tower, together with Mrs Morgan, after some
    arrangement had been made in their costumes, to which “their surprise
    and astonishment made them consent,” writes Lady Nithsdale, “without
    thinking of the consequences.” On their way to the fortress Lady
    Nithsdale entered into the details of her plan. Mrs Morgan was to wear
    a dress belonging to Mrs Mills over her own clothes, and in this dress
    Lady Nithsdale would disguise her husband, and so transformed, he could
    make his way out of the Tower. It was a bold scheme, and was admirably
    carried out in every detail.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the Governor’s, now the King’s, House, where Lord
    Nithsdale was imprisoned, Lady Nithsdale was only allowed to bring one
    friend in at a time, and first introduced Mrs Morgan, a friend, she
    said, of her husband, who had come to bid him farewell. Mrs Morgan,
    when she had come into the prisoner’s room, took off the outer dress
    she was wearing over her own, and into this Lord Nithsdale was duly
    introduced. Then Lady Nithsdale asked Mrs Morgan to go out and bring in
    her maid Evans. “I despatched her safe,” she writes, “and went partly
    downstairs to meet Mrs Mills, who held her handkerchief to her face, as
    was natural for a person going to take a last leave of a friend before
    his execution; and I desired her to do this that my lord might go out
    in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> manner. Her eyebrows were inclined to be sandy, and as
    my lord’s were dark and thick, I had prepared some paint to disguise
    him. I had also got an artificial headdress of the same coloured hair
    as hers, and rouged his face and cheeks, to conceal his beard which
    he had not had time to shave. All this provision I had before left in
    the Tower. The poor guards, whom my slight liberality the day before
    had endeared me to, let me go out quietly with my company, and were
    not so strictly on the watch as they usually had been, and the more
    so, as they were persuaded, from what I had told them the day before,
    that the prisoners would obtain their pardon. I made Mrs Mills take off
    her own hood, and put on that which I had brought for her. I then took
    her by the hand, and led her out of my lord’s chamber; and in passing
    through the next room, in which were several people, with all the
    concern imaginable, I said, ‘My dear Mrs Catherine, go in all haste,
    and send me my waiting-maid; she certainly cannot reflect how late
    it is. I am to present my petition to-night, and if I let slip this
    opportunity, I am undone, for to-morrow it is too late. Hasten her as
    much as possible, for I shall be on thorns till she comes.’ Everybody
    in the room, who were chiefly the guards’ wives and daughters, seemed
    to compassionate me exceedingly, and the sentinel officiously opened
    me the door. When I had seen her safe out, I returned to my lord, and
    finished dressing him. I had taken care that Mrs Mills did not go out
    crying, as she came in, that my lord might better pass for the lady
    who came in crying and afflicted; and the more so that as he had the
    same dress that she wore. When I had almost finished dressing my lord,
    I perceived it was growing dark, and was afraid that the light of the
    candle might betray us, so I resolved to set off. I went out leading
    him by the hand, whilst he held his handkerchief to his eyes. I spoke
    to him in the most piteous and afflicted tone, bewailing the negligence
    of my maid Evans, who had ruined me by her delay. Then I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>said, ‘My
    dear Mrs Betty, for the love of God, run quickly and bring her with
    you; you know my lodging, and if ever you made despatch in your life,
    do it at present; I am almost distracted with this disappointment.’ The
    guards opened the door, and I went downstairs with him, still conjuring
    him to make all possible dispatch. As soon as he had cleared the door,
    I made him walk before me, for fear the sentinel should take notice
    of his walk, but I continued to press him to make all the despatch
    he possibly could. At the bottom of the stairs I met my dear Evans,
    into whose hands I confided him. I had before engaged Mr Mills to be
    in readiness before the Tower, to conduct him to some place of safety
    in case we succeeded. He looked upon the affair as so very improbable
    to succeed, that his astonishment, when he saw us, threw him into
    such a consternation, that he was almost out of himself, which, Evans
    perceiving, with the greatest presence of mind, without telling Lord
    Nithsdale anything, lest he should mistrust them, conducted him to some
    of her own friends on whom she could rely, and so secured him, without
    which we certainly should have been undone. When she had conducted him,
    and left him with them, she returned to Mr Mills, who by this time
    recovered himself from his astonishment. They went home together, and
    having found a place of security, brought Lord Nithsdale to it. In the
    meantime, as I had pretended to have sent the young lady on a message,
    I was obliged to return upstairs and go back to my lord’s room in
    the same feigned anxiety of being too late, so that everybody seemed
    sincerely to sympathise in my distress. When I was in the room I talked
    as if he had been really present. I answered my own questions in my
    lord’s voice, as nearly as I could imitate it, and walked up and down
    as if we were conversing together, till I thought they had time enough
    thoroughly to clear themselves of the guards. I then thought proper to
    make off also. I opened the door and stood half in it, that those in
    the outward chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> might hear what I said, but held it so close that
    they could not look in. I bade my lord formal farewell for the night,
    and added, that something more than usual must have happened to make
    Evans negligent, on this important occasion, who had always been so
    punctual in the smallest trifles; that I saw no other remedy than to
    go in person; that if the Tower was then open, when I had finished my
    business, I would return that night; but that he might be assured I
    would be with him as early in the morning as I could gain admittance
    into the Tower, and I flattered myself I should bring more favourable
    news. Then, before I shut the door, I pulled through the string of the
    latch, so that it could only be opened on the inside. I then shut it
    with some degree of force, that I might be sure of its being well shut.
    I said to the servant, as I passed by (who was ignorant of the whole
    transaction), that he need not carry in candles to his master, till my
    lord sent for them, as he desired to finish some prayers first.” What
    an admirable wife was Lady Nithsdale, and what a devoted maid to her
    was her “dear Evans.”</p>

    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Tower from Tower Hill</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Lord Nithsdale got safely out of London in the suite of the Venetian
    Ambassador,—whose coach and six were sent some days after his escape to
    Dover,—disguised in the livery of one of the Ambassador’s footmen. From
    Dover he succeeded in getting to Calais, and later on to Rome.</p>

  <p>Although Lady Nithsdale had succeeded in rescuing her lord from the
    scaffold, her self-devotion did not end there, her task, she thought,
    was still incomplete. In spite of the personal peril she herself ran if
    found in England or over the border, for the King was mightily annoyed
    at the ruse by which she had snatched her husband from the jaws of
    death, Lady Nithsdale determined to protect her son’s estates, which,
    owing to the attainder of his father, were now Government property. Her
    first step was to recover the papers she had hidden in the garden at
    Torreglas. “As I had hazarded my life for the father,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> she writes, “I
    would not do less than hazard it for the son.” Attended by the faithful
    Evans and her groom, who had accompanied her upon the memorable ride
    from York to London, Lady Nithsdale returned to Dumfriesshire. Having
    arrived safely at Torreglas, she put a brave face upon her errand, and
    invited her neighbours to come and see her as if she had been sent by
    the Government itself. On the night before these invitations were due,
    this most astute and courageous lady dug up the family papers in the
    garden, sending them off at once to a place of safety in the charge of
    a trusty retainer. Before day broke she had again started on her return
    journey to the south, and while the Dumfries justices were laying their
    wise heads together, and consulting whether they should or should not
    give orders for the seizure of Lady Nithsdale, she had put many miles
    between herself and them. When the good folk of Dumfries arrived at
    Torreglas, they found that the lady they sought in the name of the law
    had given them the slip.</p>

  <p>It is pleasant to picture the impotent rage of George Rex when he heard
    of this second defiance of his kingly authority; he declared that Lady
    Nithsdale did whatever she pleased in spite of him, and that she had
    given him more trouble than any other woman in the whole of Europe.</p>

  <p>Lady Nithsdale joined her husband in Rome, where they lived many years
    together, he dying in 1749, and his devoted wife following him to the
    grave soon afterwards. She rests in the beautiful Fitzalan Chapel,
    near Arundel Castle. One hopes that the faithful Welsh maid, Evans,
    was with them till the end. According to Lord de Ros, Lady Nithsdale’s
    portrait, painted by Godfrey Kneller, still hangs in her Scottish home.
    “Her hair,” he says, “is bright brown, slightly powdered; with large
    soft eyes, regular features, and a fair complexion. Her soft expression
    and delicate appearance give little indication of the strength of mind
    and courage she displayed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> Her dress is blue silk, with a border of
    cambric, and over it a cloak of brown silk.”</p>

  <p>Another of the Jacobite lords, Wintoun, also escaped from the Tower.
    Little is known regarding the manner in which he broke his prison and
    thus cheated the headsman, but it is supposed that he managed to saw
    through the bars of his window, having previously bribed his gaoler
    to let him be free and undisturbed in his work of filing the iron. In
    his case there were no romantic details, or, if there were any, they
    have not come down to us. Of Lord Wintoun’s escape, Lord de Ros writes:
    “Being well seconded by friends of the cause in London, he was conveyed
    safely to the Continent.”</p>

  <p>Another large batch of prisoners who were suspected of being Jacobites
    came into the Tower in the year 1722, the most notable of them being
    Francis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, Lords
    North, Orrery, and Grey, Thomas Layer Corkran, Christopher Layer, and
    an Irish clergyman named Kelly. Of these, the last was the only one
    executed on the charge of high treason.</p>

  <p>The plot in which these persons of varying degrees were accused of
    being implicated, was to seize the Tower, and raise a rebellion in
    favour of the Chevalier, an idea which goes to show that the old
    fortress was even as late as the days of our first Hanoverian sovereign
    regarded as an essential to the assumption of the supreme power in
    the country. Atterbury was attainted and banished, after undergoing a
    strict imprisonment, which he endured with much patience from the 24th
    of August 1722, until the 18th of January in the following year.</p>

  <p class="noindent">as Pope has sung it. Atterbury never returned to England, dying after

  <p>In 1724 the Earl of Suffolk was committed to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>Tower “for
    granting protection in breach of the standing orders of the House of

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> coming to the year 1746, when the old fortress was the scene of
    the imprisonment and death of the Jacobite leaders of the rebellion of
    1745, it will be necessary to enter at some length into the treatment
    of some obscure Scotch prisoners who, shortly before the great outbreak
    in Scotland, were put to death in the Tower. The story of the deaths of
    these unfortunate men has never appeared in any account of the Tower
    and its prisoners, and I am therefore all the more anxious to give
    as full an account as I have been able to find of that event. It was
    owing to the kindness of Mr Gardiner, who placed in my hands a pamphlet

    Macpherson and Shaw, that I became aware of this tragic story.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>This triple execution, which, as I have said, took place shortly
    before the Jacobite rising in Scotland in the “’45,” may have had
    something to do with the strong feeling against the English Government
    which prevailed in the North; it was certainly one of those acts by
    which governments make themselves and their ministers odious. And the
    execution on Tower Green in 1744 may well have caused the unpopularity,
    not to say hatred, amongst the Scotch of the English Government.</p>

  <p>The only reference I have been able to find to this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>event are two
    short passages in Hume and Smollett’s “History of England” (vol. xi.
    page 164), and the other in a letter from Horace Walpole to Sir Horace
    Mann (“Walpole’s Letters,” vol. i., Letter <span class="allsmcap">LXXIV.</span>).</p>

  <p>“King George was in Germany,” writes Hume, “the Duke of Cumberland, at
    the head of the British army, was employed in Flanders, and great part
    of the Highlanders were keen for insurrection; their natural feelings
    were, on this occasion, stimulated by the suggestion of revenge. At the
    beginning of the war, a regiment of those people had been formed and
    transported with the rest of the British troops to Flanders. Before
    they were embarked, a number of them deserted with their arms, on
    pretence that they had been decoyed into the service by promises and
    assurances that they should never be sent abroad; and this was really
    the case. They were overtaken by a body of horse, persuaded to submit,
    brought back to London, pinioned like malefactors, and tried for
    desertion; three were shot to death <i lang="la">in terrorem</i>, and the rest
    were sent to the plantations. Those who suffered were persons of some
    consequence in their own country, and their fate was deeply resented by
    the clans to which they belonged. It was considered a national outrage,
    and the Highlanders, who are naturally vindictive, waited impatiently
    for an opportunity of vengeance.”</p>

  <p>So far, the historian upon the subject. This is the letter-writer’s
    account of the matter. “We are,” writes Walpole to Mann on the 19th
    May 1743, “in more confusion than we care to own. There lately came
    up a highland regiment from Scotland to be sent abroad. One heard of
    nothing but their good discipline and quiet disposition. When the day
    came for their going to the water-side, one hundred and nine of them
    mutinied, and marched away in a body. They did not care to go to where
    it would be equivocal for what King they fought. Three companies of
    dragoons are sent after them. If you happen to hear of any rising,
    don’t be surprised—I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> not, I assure you. Sir Robert Monroe, their
    Lieutenant-Colonel, before their leaving Scotland, asked some of the
    Ministry: ‘But suppose there should be any rebellion in Scotland, what
    shall we do for these eight hundred men?’ it was answered, ‘Why, there
    would be eight hundred fewer rebels there.’”</p>

  <p>It seems to have been a scandalous act on the part of the Government
    to have drafted these Scottish soldiers to Flanders immediately upon
    their arrival in London, after they had promised that they should not
    be taken on foreign service. And the cruelly harsh treatment meted out
    to the deserters, and the execution of the three men, must have stirred
    up a strong feeling of hatred in Scotland against George the Second’s
    Government—a hatred which burst into open flame in the “’45.”</p>

  <p>The next event in the history of the Tower is the imprisonment and
    execution of the Scotch Jacobite lords after the rebellion of 1745. For
    more than a score of years the old fortress had been free of political
    prisoners, and Tower Hill had seen no more executions. The blood of the
    “Rebel Lords,” as they were called, was the last that dyed the scaffold
    in England. These “Rebel Lords” were the Marquis of Tullibardine, the
    Earl of Cromarty, and Lords Kilmarnock and Balmerino. Tullibardine
    had already taken up arms for the cause of James in 1715, and when he
    was taken prisoner after the “’45,” was a broken-down, elderly man
    whose life was drawing to a close, and who was so feeble that, when
    the standard of Prince Charles was unfurled at Glenfinnan, he had to
    be supported by men upon either side whilst he held the flagstaff. His
    father, the Duke of Athol, had obtained leave from George I. to will
    his title and estates to his second surviving son, James, who succeeded
    to the dukedom in 1729. Tullibardine had meanwhile fled to France, but
    in 1719 made a desperate attempt to raise the clans at Kinsale. He was
    defeated by General Wightmore at Glenshiel, and a proclamation was
    issued for his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>apprehension, together with the Earl Marischal and
    the Earl of Seaforth. A reward of two thousand pounds was promised for
    the capture of any of these noblemen. During the next twenty-six years
    Tullibardine’s life was passed in France. On the 25th of July 1745,
    he landed with Prince Charles at Borodale, and, as it has been said,
    it was he who unfurled the Prince’s standard on the 19th of August at
    Glenfinnan.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Scotch Prisoners entering the Tower 1742</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>After the defeat of the Pretender’s forces at Culloden, Tullibardine
    fled to Mull, but he was too broken in health even to attempt escape
    from the English troops sent out for his capture, and finally
    surrendered himself to Buchanan of Drumskill. Taken first to Dumbarton
    Castle, and then to Edinburgh, he was sent from the latter place to
    London by sea. On his arrival at the Tower, Tullibardine was in an
    almost dying state, and Lord Cornwallis, the Governor, was allowed
    by the following order, to send a Dr Wilmott to attend “the person
    formerly called Marquis of Tullibardine, a prisoner in your custody,
    from time to time as he shall desire during his indisposition, provided
    the same to be in the presence of you or the Lieutenant.” On the 9th
    of July this staunch Cavalier died in the Tower, thus escaping a
    public execution; he was only fifty-eight years old. He was buried in
    St Peter’s Chapel. William, Earl of Kilmarnock, who was head of the
    family of Errol, had fought at Culloden, and was taken prisoner with
    Lord Balmerino. These, together with the Earl of Cromarty, who had
    been captured at the castle of Dunrobin, in Sutherland, were brought
    to London by sea, the warrant which committed them to the Tower being
    dated the 28th of July.</p>

  <p>The following letter from Mrs Osborn, the famous Dorothy Osborn’s
    great-niece by marriage, and a daughter of the first Lord Torrington,
    and wife of John Osborn, of Chicksands, in Bedfordshire, to her son,
    Sir Danvers Osborn, dated 9th December 1745, gives an interesting
    picture of the state of public feeling. She writes of the “most
    shameful panick” which had seized London on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> news of the advance
    of the Scottish army. People were hurrying from their country houses
    for shelter in the capital, and bringing their plate with them wherever
    they could. This “panick” lasted for four days, and then came the news
    of the retreat from Derby northwards, and people went home again. She
    says: “The Prisoners come to the Tower a fryday, ’tis not yet clear if
    the Pretender’s brother is there. They have strong suspicion still, but
    the Ministry don’t choose to talk about it.” In the following June,
    Mrs Osborn writes from Kensington: “’Tis thought ’twill be August
    before the Lords can be try’d. After some forms are past, the Peers
    must have 20 days notice. Lady Cromarty is in town, has been at the
    Tower to enquire after her lord. She was at Williamson’s, and cryd most
    bitterly, but no one is suffered so much as to look up at the windows.
    They were all brought into Williamson’s, and from there one by one
    conducted to their apartments. No one knows where the other is, and
    they are kept very strict, since the King of France has ordered a most
    insolent Letter, and takes himself to be King of England to forbid us
    punishing the Rebels. Is the Prelates got off or not?” asks Mrs Osborn,
    adding rather cold-bloodedly: “I wish they could have been beheaded at
    Edinburgh, and not make such a long piece of work as the forms will do
    here.”</p>

  <p>The trial of these “Rebel Lords” took place at Westminster Hall
    with much ceremonial. The Lord High Steward, Philip Yorke, Earl
    of Hardwicke, arrived from Ormond Street, attended by a train of
    gentlemen-at-arms, Black Rod and Garter King at Arms supporting him.
    He was received by the guard in Old Palace Yard, “by drums beating as
    to the Royal family.” The peers were in their robes, and the grand old
    Hall was filled to its utmost limits with a vast crowd of spectators.
    Horace Walpole, writing to Mann, says: “I am this moment come from the
    conclusion of the greatest and most melancholy scene I ever saw; you
    will easily guess it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> trial of the rebel Lords. As it was the
    most interesting sight, it was the most solemn and fine. A coronation
    is a puppet show, and all the splendours of it idle; but this sight
    at once feasted one’s eyes, and engaged all one’s passions. It began
    last Monday; the three parts of Westminster Hall were enclosed with
    galleries, and hung with scarlet; and the whole ceremony was conducted
    with the most awful solemnity and decency, except in the one point
    of leaving the prisoners at the bar amidst the idle curiosity of the
    crowd, and even with the witnesses who had sworn against them, while
    the Lords adjourned to their own house to consult. No part of the
    Royal Family was there, which was a proper regard for the unhappy
    men, who were become their victims. One hundred and thirty-nine Lords
    were present, and made a noble sight on their benches, frequent
    and full. The Chancellor was Lord High Steward, but though a most
    comely personage with a fine voice, his behaviour was mean, curiously
    searching for occasion to bow to the Minister (Henry Pelham) that is no
    Peer, and consequently applying to the other Ministers in a manner for
    their orders: and not even ready at the ceremonial. To the prisoners
    he was peevish; and instead of keeping to the humane dignity of the
    law of England, whose character it is to point out favour to the
    criminal, he crossed them, and almost scolded at any offer they made
    towards defence. Lord Kilmarnock is past forty, but looks younger. He
    is tall and slender, with an extremely fine person; his behaviour a
    most just mixture between dignity and submission; if in anything to be
    reprehended, a little affected, and his hair too exactly dressed for
    a man in his situation. But when I say this, it is not to find fault,
    but to show how little fault there is to be found. For Lord Balmerino,
    he is the most natural, brave old fellow I ever saw; the lightest
    intrepidity, even to indifference. At the bar he behaved like a soldier
    and a man; in the intervals of form with carelessness and humour. He
    pressed extremely to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> his wife, his pretty Peggy, with him in the
    Tower. When they were brought from the Tower in separate coaches, there
    was some dispute in which the axe must go, old Balmerino cried, ‘Come,
    come, put it with me!’ At the bar he played with his fingers upon the
    axe, while he talked with the gentleman gaoler; and one day, somebody
    coming up to listen, he took the blade and held it like a fan between
    their faces. During the trial a little boy was near him, but not tall
    enough to see, he made room for the child, and placed him near himself.
    When the trial began, the two Earls (Kilmarnock and Cromarty) pleaded
    guilty, Balmerino not guilty, saying he would prove his not being at
    the taking of the Castle of Carlisle, as was said in the indictment.
    Then the King’s Counsel opened, and Serjeant Skinner pronounced the
    most absurd speech imaginable. Then some witnesses were examined,
    whom afterwards the old hero shook cordially by the hand. The Lords
    withdrew to their house, and returning, demanded of the judges whether,
    one point not being proved, though all the rest were, the indictment
    was false? to which they unanimously answered in the negative. Then
    the Lord Steward asked the Peers severally whether Lord Balmerino
    was guilty. All said, ‘Guilty upon honour,’ and then adjourned, the
    prisoner having begged pardon for giving them so much trouble. On
    Wednesday the prisoners were again brought to Westminster Hall, at
    about eleven o’clock, to receive sentence; and being asked what they
    had to say, Lord Kilmarnock, with a fine voice, read a very fine
    speech, confessing the extent of his crime, but offering his principles
    as some alleviation.”</p>

  <p>The executions were fixed to take place on the 18th of August, the
    news being broken to Lord Kilmarnock by his friend, Mr J. Foster,
    a clergyman. When old Balmerino was told by the Lieutenant of the
    Tower, General Williamson, of the fatal day, he was at dinner with
    his wife (Margaret, daughter of Captain Chalmers). “Lady Balmerino,”
    writes Williamson, “being very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> surprised, he desired her not
    to be concerned at it, his lady seemed very disconsolate, and rose
    immediately from table, on which he started from his chair, and said
    ‘Pray, my Lady, sit down, for it shall not spoil your dinner.’ ‘The
    brave old fellow,’ as Walpole calls Lord Balmerino, and with justice,
    turned upon the General, ‘Lieutenant,’ he said, ‘with your damned
    warrant you have spoiled my Lady’s dinner.’”</p>

  <p>The following account of the execution of the Jacobite leaders is taken
    from the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for the month of August 1745, and
    appears to have been the most accurate and the most detailed:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At six o’clock a troop of lifeguards, and 1000 of the
      footguards—being fifteen men out of each company, marched from the
      parade in St James’s park thro’ the city to Tower-hill, to attend
      the execution of the Earl of Kilmarnock and the Lord Balmerino,
      and being arrived there were posted in lines from the Tower to
      the scaffold, and all around it. About 8 o’clock the Sheriffs of
      London, and their under sheriffs and their officers, <i>viz.</i>
      six sergeants at mace, six yeomen, and the executioner, met at
      the Mitre Tavern in Fenchurch Street, where they breakfasted, and
      went from thence to the house, lately the Transport Office, on
      Tower-hill near Catherine’s Court, hired by them for the reception
      of the said lords, before they should be conducted to the scaffold
      which was erected about thirty yards from the said house.</p>

    <p>At ten o’clock the block was fixed on the stage and covered with
      black cloth, and several sacks of sawdust up to strew on it;
      soon after their coffins were brought, covered with black cloth,
      ornamented with gilt nails, etc. On the Earl of Kilmarnock’s
      was a plate with this inscription, “Guliemus Come de Kilmarnock
      decollatur 18 Augusti 1746. Etat suae 42,” with an Earl’s coronet
      over it, and six coronets over the six handles; and on Lord
      Balmerino’s, was a plate with this inscription, “Arthurus Dominus
      de Balmerino decollatur 18 Augusti 1746. Etat suae 58,” with a
      baron’s coronet over it, and six others over the six handles. At a
      quarter after ten the Sheriffs went in procession to the outward
      gate of the Tower, and after knocking at it some time, a warder
      within asked, “Who’s there?” The officer without replied, “The
      sheriffs of London and Middlesex.” The warder then asked, “What
      do they want?” The officer answered, “The bodies of William, Earl
      of Kilmarnock, and Arthur, Lord Balmerino,” upon which the warder
      within said, “I will go and inform the Lieutenant of the Tower,”
      and in about ten minutes the Lieutenant of the Tower with the Earl
      of Kilmarnock, and Major White with Lord Balmerino, guarded by
      several of the warders, came to the gate; the prisoners were then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
      delivered to the Sheriffs who gave proper receipt for their bodies
      to the Lieutenant, who as usual said, “God bless King George!”
      to which the Earl of Balmerino assented by a bow, and the Lord
      Balmerino said, “God bless King J——s.” Lord Kilmarnock had met Lord
      Balmerino at the foot of the first stairs, he embraced him, who
      said to him, “My lord, I am heartily sorry to have your company in
      this expedition.” Soon after the procession, moving in a slow and
      solemn manner, appeared in the following order:—</p>

    <ol class="hang">
      <li>The Constable of the Tower.</li>
      <li>The Knight Marshal’s men and Tipsters.</li>
      <li>The Sheriffs’ Officers.</li>
      <li>The Sheriffs, the prisoners, and their chaplains. Mr Sheriff Blachford
        walking with the Earl of Kilmarnock, and Mr Sheriff Cockayne with the Lord Balmerino.</li>
      <li>The Tower Warders.</li>
      <li>A guard of musqueteers.</li>
      <li>The two hearses and a mourning coach.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When the procession had passed through the lines within the area
      of the circle formed by the guards, the passage was closed, and
      the troops of horse who were in the rear of the foot in the lines
      wheeled off, and drew five feet deep behind the foot, on the south
      side of the hill facing the scaffold. The lords were conducted into
      separate apartments in the house, facing the steps of the scaffold;
      their friends being admitted to them. The Earl of Kilmarnock was
      attended by the Rev. Mr Foster, a dissenting minister, and the Rev.
      Mr Hume, a near relative of the Earl of Hume; and the chaplain
      of the Tower, and another clergyman of the Church of England,
      accompanied Lord Balmerino; who on entering the door of the house,
      hearing several of the spectators ask eagerly “Which is Lord
      Balmerino?” answered smiling, “I am Lord Balmerino, gentlemen, at
      your service.” The parlour and passage of the house, the rails
      enclosing the way thence to the scaffold, and the rails about
      it, were all hung with black at the sheriff’s expense. The Lord
      Kilmarnock in the apartment allotted to him, spent about an hour
      at his devotions with Mr Foster, who assisted him with prayer and
      exhortation. After which Lord Balmerino pursuant to his request,
      being admitted to confer with the Earl, first thank’d him for the
      favour, and then ask’d, if his lordship knew of any order signed by
      the Prince (meaning the Pretender’s son) to give no quarter at the
      battle of Culloden! And the Earl answering No, the Lord Balmerino
      added, nor I neither, and therefore it seems to be an invention to
      justify their own murders! The Earl replied he did not think this
      a fair inference, because he was informed, after he was prisoner
      at Inverness, by several officers, that such an order, signed by
      George Murray, was in the Duke’s custody; “George Murray!” said
      Lord Balmerino, “then they should not charge it on the Prince!”
      Then he took his leave, embracing Lord Kilmarnock, with the same
      kind of noble and generous compliments, as he had used before,
      “My dear Lord Kilmarnock, I am only sorry that I cannot pay the
      reckoning alone; once more, farewell for ever!” His persone was
      tall and graceful, his countenance mild, and his complexion pale;
      and more so as he had been indisposed. He then returned to his
      own room. The Earl then, with the company kneeling down, join’d
      in a prayer delivered by Mr Foster; after which having sat a
      few moments, and taken a second refreshment of a glass of wine,
      he expressed a desire that Lord Balmerino might go first to the
      scaffold; but being informed this could not be, as his lordship
      was named first on the warrant: he appeared satisfied, saluted
      his friends, saying he would make no speech on the scaffold,
      but desired the minister to assist him in his last moments, and
      then accordingly with other friends, proceeded with him to the
      scaffold. The multitude who had long been expecting to see him on
      such an awful occasion, on his first appearing upon the scaffold,
      dressed in black with a countenance and demeanour, testifying great
      contrition, showed the deepest signs of commiseration and pity; and
      his lordship at the same time, being struck with such a variety of
      dreadful objects at once, the multitude, the block, his coffin,
      the executioner, the instrument of death, turned about to Mr Hume,
      and said, “Hume, this is terrible,” tho’ without changing his
      voice or countenance. After putting up a short prayer, concluding
      with a petition for his Majesty King George, and the royal family,
      in vindication of his declaration: in his speech, his lordship
      embraced and took a last leave of his friends. The executioner, who
      before had something administered to keep him from fainting, was
      so affected by his lordship’s distress, and the awfulness of the
      scene that, on asking his forgiveness, he burst into tears. My Lord
      bade him take courage, giving him at the same time a purse with
      five guineas, and telling him that he would drop his handkerchief
      as a signal for the stroke. He proceeded, with the help of his
      gentlemen, to make ready for the block, by taking off his coat,
      and the bag from his hair, which was then tucked up under a napkin
      cap, but this being made up so wide as not to keep up his long
      hair, the making it less caused a little delay; his neck being
      laid bare, tucking down the collar of his shirt and waistcoat, he
      kneeled down on a black cushion at the block, and drew his cap
      over his eyes, in doing which, as well as in putting up his hair,
      his hands were observed to shake; but either to support himself,
      or as a more convenient posture for devotion, he happened to lay
      both his hands upon the block, which the executioner observing,
      prayed his lordship to let them fall, lest they should be mangled,
      or break the blow. He was then told that the neck of his waistcoat
      was in the way, upon which he rose, and with the help of a friend
      took it off, and the neck being made bare to the shoulders, he
      kneeled down as before. In the meantime, when all things were ready
      for the execution, and the black bays which hung over the rails
      of the scaffold having, by direction of the Colonel of the Guard,
      or the Sheriffs, been turned up that the people might see all the
      circumstances of the execution; in about two minutes (the time he
      before fixed) after he kneeled down, his lordship dropping his
      handkerchief, the executioner at once severed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> head from the
      body, except only a small part of the skin, which was immediately
      divided by a gentle stroke; the head was received in a piece of red
      baize, and, with the body, immediately put into the coffin. The
      scaffold was then cleansed from the blood, fresh sawdust strewed,
      and, that no appearance of a former execution might remain, the
      executioner changed such of his clothes as appeared bloody.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the meantime Lord Balmerino was waiting for his own end with
    that imperturbable courage which never seemed to desert him. He
    talked cheerfully with his friends, and drinking a glass of wine,
    blithely asked them to drink to his “ain degrae ta haiven.” When
    the under-sheriff came to summon him to the scaffold the old lord
    interrupted him by asking how the executioner had done his work
    upon Lord Kilmarnock, and remarking that it was well done, turned
    to his friends and said, “Gentlemen, I shall detain you no longer,”
    immediately proceeding to the scaffold, “which he mounted with so easy
    an air as astounded the spectators.” He wore the uniform in which
    he had fought at the battle of Culloden, a blue coat turned up with
    red, with brass buttons, and a tie wig. Having walked several times
    round the scaffold, he bowed to the people, and going up to the coffin
    lying ready to receive his body, he read the inscription, saying, “It
    is right”; then he carefully examined the block which he called his
    “pillow of rest.” He required his spectacles to read the speech he had
    prepared, and “read it with an audible voice, which, so far from being
    filled with passionate invective, mentioned his Majesty as a prince
    of the greatest magnanimity and mercy, at the same time that, thro’
    erroneous political principles, it denied him a right to the allegiance
    of his people.” This speech was duly handed over to the Sheriff, and
    when the executioner came forward to beg Lord Balmerino’s pardon, as
    was the custom, the staunch old nobleman said, “Friend, you need not
    ask me forgiveness, the execution of your duty is commendable!” Then
    he gave him three guineas, adding, “Friend, I never was rich, this is
    all the money I have now, and I am sorry I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>cannot add anything to it
    but my coat and waistcoat.” These he himself placed upon his coffin,
    together with his neckcloth, and putting on a plaid cap, declared
    that he died a Scotchman. He next bade farewell to his friends, and
    then looking down upon the crowd said to a gentleman who stood near
    him, “Perhaps some may think my behaviour too bold, but remember,
    sir, that I now declare it is the effect of confidence in God, and a
    good conscience, and I should dissemble, if I should shew any signs
    of fear.” As he passed the executioner he took the axe from his hand
    and felt the edge, and, returning it to the man, clapped him on the
    shoulder to encourage him. Turning down the collar of his shirt he
    showed the man where to strike, bidding him “do it resolutely, for
    in that would consist his kindness.” After giving the Tower warders
    some money, he asked which was his hearse, and ordered the driver to
    bring it nearer. “Immediately,” says the writer in the <cite>Gentleman’s
    Magazine</cite>, “without trembling, or changing countenance, he again
    knelt at the block, and having with his arms stretched out, said, ‘O
    Lord, reward my friends; forgive my enemies—and receive my soul,’
    he gave the signal by letting them fall, but his uncommon firmness
    and intrepidity, and the unexpected suddenness of the signal, so
    surprised the executioner, that though he struck the part directed,
    the blow was not given with strength enough to wound him very deep; on
    which it seemed as if he made an effort to turn his head towards the
    executioner, and the under jaw fell and returned very quick, like anger
    and gnashing the teeth; but it could not be otherwise, the part being
    convulsed. A second blow immediately succeeding, the first rendered
    him, however, quite insensible, and a third finished the work. His head
    was received in a piece of red baize, and with his body put into the
    coffin, which, at his particular request, was placed on that of the
    late Marquis of Tullibardine in St Peter’s Chapel Church in the Tower,
    all three Lords lying in one grave.”</p>

      it Appear’d from a rais’d point of View on the North side, Aug<sup>ṭ</sup> y<sup>e</sup>

  </div>

  <p>At the close of that year the brother of the ill-fated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> Earl of
    Derwentwater, Charles Radclyffe, was also executed on the same spot.
    He came very gallantly to the scaffold dressed “in scarlet trimm’d
    with gold, a gold laced waistcoat, and white feathers in his hat.”
    He was actually Earl of Derwentwater, his coffin in St Giles’s in
    the Fields bearing the inscription, “Carolus Radclyffe, Comes de
    Derwentwater, decollatur, 8 Dec. 1746, Ætis 53. Requiescat in Pace.”
    But although the Derwentwater estates had only been confiscated to
    the Crown for his life a clause in a later Act of Parliament directed
    that “the issue of any person attainted of High Treason, born and
    bred in any foreign dominion, and a Roman Catholic, shall forfeit his
    reversion of such estate, and the remainder shall for ever be fixed
    in the Crown, his son is absolutely deprived of any title or interest
    in the fortune of that ancient family to the amount of better than
    £200,000.” Charles Radclyffe, was the younger brother of James, Earl
    of Derwentwater, and with him had been taken prisoner at Preston,
    and condemned to death after trial and conviction. But he had been
    respited, and it was thought would ultimately have been pardoned, had
    he not escaped from his prison in Newgate. He went to France, and
    following the Pretender to Rome, was given a small pension by that
    prince, and this was literally all that he had to live upon. Later, he
    returned to Paris, and there he married the widow of Lord Newburgh, by
    whom he had a son. He came to England in 1733, but went back again to
    France and accepted a commission from Louis <abbr title="14th">XIV.</abbr>, “to act as officer
    in the late rebellion.” But before he could reach Scotland on board
    the <cite>Esperance</cite>, he, his men, and several other Scotch and Irish
    officers were captured by an English vessel, and Charles Radclyffe
    ended his unfortunate career as intrepidly as he had lived it, on Tower Hill.</p>

  <p>By this time the axe had almost done its work in England, and Tower
    Hill was to see only one more head laid upon the block—that of Simon
    Fraser, Lord Lovat, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>who was the last of the Jacobite lords to be
    executed. Lord Lovat’s long life had begun in 1667, and it had been
    as wild and vicious as it had been lengthy. Like the Regent Orléans,
    he might very justly have been called a “fanfaron de vice.” In his
    youth he had lived in Paris, where he had become a Roman Catholic, if
    such a man as Lovat could be said to have any religion. He enjoyed
    what was probably a unique experience in that he was imprisoned both
    in the Bastille and in the Tower, for although there is no authority
    for saying that he was the only man who underwent imprisonment in the
    great State prisons of England and of France, on the other hand, there
    is also no authority for saying that he was not. He had been in the
    Bastille in 1702, on the charge of having betrayed a Jacobite plot to
    the English Government. Although not actually in arms during the “’45”
    rebellion, Lovat had kept up a correspondence with the Young Pretender;
    and this correspondence cost him his life. When captured at the Isle
    of Moran, after the Battle of Culloden, he was so infirm that he had
    to be carried to Edinburgh in a litter, and thence in the same way to
    Berwick, and so to London.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It was at the White Hart at St Albans that Hogarth met him, and there
    it was that great artist painted the admirable little full-length
    portrait of the old Jacobite, which is now in the National Portrait
    Gallery. Hogarth used to say that he painted Lovat as he sat counting
    up the numbers of the rebel forces on his fingers. The engraving of
    this portrait, taken by the artist himself, had an immense success at
    the time, the printing press being kept employed day and night, and for
    a considerable time Hogarth made twelve pounds a day by its sale.</p>

  <p>Lovat arrived at the Tower on the 15th of August 1746, and according to
    the account given in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for that month,
    came “in an open Landau driven by six horses, guarded by a party of
    Liguier’s Horse, and accompany’d in the Landau by an officer—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> he
    passed through the streets he seemed very unconcerned, but coming
    on the hill, he turn’d his eyes towards the scaffold erecting for
    beholding the execution of the lords, and lifting up his hands, said,
    ‘A few days, and it will be my awful fate!’”</p>

  <p>The whole aspect of Tower Hill, with the exception of the appearance
    of the old fortress and its outer walls, has been entirely changed
    since Lovat saw it with the huge scaffoldings being erected for the
    spectators of his companions’ executions—and for his own a few months
    later. The house into which they were led to await their death no
    longer exists. It occupied the north-east corner of Catherine’s Court,
    and was formerly the Transport Office. From a raised platform, which
    was flush with the scaffold, the Jacobite lords walked from the house,
    which stood immediately opposite to the spot where so many remarkable
    men have perished by the axe of the headsman. During the last few years
    the actual site of the scaffold has been marked by a tablet in the
    garden that now surrounds the place of execution, where the axe had
    done its work from the time of Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick,
    the son of the Duke of Clarence, to that of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat.
    With the latter ended the long list of State executions on Tower Hill,
    which, during five centuries, had stained its soil with some of the
    noblest blood in the country.</p>

  <p>On the 18th of December, Lovat was taken from the Tower to the House of
    Lords, where the articles of his impeachment were read to him. The best
    account of the trial is undoubtedly that contained in one of the many
    letters written by Horace Walpole to Sir Horace Mann. Writing on the
    20th of March 1747, Walpole says: “I have been living at old Lovat’s
    trial, and was willing to have it over before I talked to you about
    it. It lasted seven days; the evidence was as strong as possible; and
    after all he had denounced he made no defence. The Solicitor-General
    (Sir William Murray), who was one of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>the managers of the House of
    Commons, shone extremely. The Attorney-General (Sir Dudley Ryder),
    who is a much greater lawyer, is cold and tedious. The old creature’s
    behaviour has been foolish, and at last indecent.</p>

  <p>“When he came to the Tower, he told them that if he were not so old
    and infirm, they would find it difficult to keep him there. They
    told him they had kept much younger. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but they were
    inexperienced; they had not broke so many gaols as I have.’ At his own
    home he used to say, that for thirty years of his life he never saw
    a gallows but it made his neck ache. His last act was to shift his
    treason upon his eldest son, whom he forced into the rebellion. He told
    Williamson, the Lieutenant of the Tower, ‘We will hang my eldest son,
    and then my second shall marry your niece.’ He has a sort of ready
    humour at repartee, not very well adapted to his situation. One day
    that Williamson complained that he could not sleep, he was so haunted
    with rats, he replied: ‘What do you say, that you are so haunted with
    Ratcliffes?’ The first day, as he was brought to his trial, a woman
    looked into the coach, and said: ‘You ugly old dog, don’t you think
    you will have that frightful head cut off?’ He replied: ‘You ugly old
    ——, I believe I shall!’ At his trial he affected great weakness and
    infirmities, but often broke out into passions; particularly at the
    first witness, who was his vassal. He asked him how he dared to come
    thither; the man replied, to satisfy his conscience. The two last days
    he behaved ridiculously, joking, and making everybody laugh, even at
    the sentence. He said to Lord Ilchester, who sat near the bar: ‘Je
    meurs pour ma patrie, et ne m’en soucie guère.’ When he withdrew, he
    said: ‘Adieu, my Lords, we shall never meet again in the same place!’
    He says he will be hanged, for his neck is so short and bearded that
    he should be struck in the shambles. I did not think it possible to
    feel so little as I did at so melancholy a spectacle, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> tyranny and
    villany, wound up by buffoonery, took off all edge of concern.”</p>

  <p>Thursday, April 9th, was the day fixed for Lovat’s execution, and
    shortly before he arrived on Tower Hill one of the scaffoldings built
    for the spectators of his execution, and which held nearly a thousand
    people, suddenly collapsed, eight or ten persons being killed outright,
    whilst many others had broken legs and arms. Whatever may be thought of
    the action of the Hanoverian Court in beheading the rebellious Jacobite
    lords, there is no doubt that a richly-deserved punishment was meted
    out to Lovat. Forty years before, at the last session of the Scottish
    Parliament, previous to the union of the two countries, Lord Belhaven
    had declared in a memorable speech, that Captain Fraser, as Lord Lovat
    then was, “deserved, if practicable, to have been hanged five several
    times, in five different places, and upon five different accounts at
    least, as having been a traitor to the Court of St James’s, a traitor
    to the Court of St Germains, a traitor to the Court of Versailles, and
    a traitor to his own country of Scotland; that he deserved to be hanged
    as a condemned criminal, outlaw, and fugitive, for his treatment of the
    widow of the late Lord Lovat’s sister. Nay, so hardened was Captain
    Fraser, that he erected a gallows, and threatened to hang thereon the
    lady’s brother, and some other gentlemen of quality who accompanied
    him, in going to rescue her out of that criminal’s cruel hands.” This
    was in 1706, and to judge by all accounts of Lovat’s career in the
    next forty years, he deserved to be hanged yet five times more, “if
    practicable.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>Lovat waked about three o’clock on the morning of his execution, and
    was heard to “pray with genuine emotion.” He was very cheerful, and
    having ordered his wig to be sent to the barber, “that he might have
    time to comb it out genteely, he sat down to a breakfast of minced
    veal,” ordering coffee and chocolate for his friends, whose health he
    drank in wine and water. When the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>Sheriff of London came to demand
    his body, he responded to the call with alacrity, saying, “I am ready”;
    and on his way downstairs accepted General Williamson’s invitation to
    rest in the Lieutenant’s room, and asked him in French if he could
    “take leave of his lady, and thank her for her civilities. But the
    General told his lordship in the same language that she was too much
    affected with his lordship’s misfortunes to bear the shock of seeing
    him, and therefore hoped his lordship would excuse her.” From the
    Lieutenant’s house, Lord Lovat was conveyed in the Governor’s coach
    to the Outer Gate, where he was delivered over to the Sheriffs, who
    took him in another coach to the house which had already served as the
    last resting-place of Lords Balmerino and Kilmarnock on the way to the
    scaffold. Here a room had been got ready for him, hung with black cloth
    and with sconces. At first his friends were denied admittance, but upon
    Lord Lovat applying to the Sheriffs, leave was granted. During the time
    of waiting Lovat thanked the Sheriffs for “their favours,” and desired
    that his clothes might be given up to his friends with his body, also
    asking that his head might be received in a white cloth, and put into
    the coffin. This was promised, as well as that the holding up of the
    head at the corner of the scaffold should be dispensed with. Lord Lovat
    was assisted up the steps of the scaffold by two warders, and looking
    round on the great multitude of people, exclaimed, “God save us! why
    should there be such a bustle about taking off an old grey head, that
    cannot go up three steps without three bodies to support it.” Then
    seeing that one of his friends looked very unhappy, he slapped him on
    the shoulder, saying: “Cheer up thy heart, man, I am not afraid, why
    should you?” Like old Lord Balmerino, he felt the edge of the axe, and
    examined his coffin, upon which was inscribed: “Simon Fraser Dominus
    de Lovat, Decollat April 9, 1747. Ætat Suae 80.” After repeating
    some lines from Horace and Ovid, according to the <cite>Gentleman’s
    Magazine</cite>, “he called his solicitor and agent in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> Scotland, Mr Wm.
    Fraser, and presented him with his gold-headed cane, and said: ‘I
    deliver you this cane in token of my sense of your faithful services,
    and of my committing to you all the power I leave upon earth,’ and then
    embraced him. He also called for Mr James Fraser, and said, ‘My dear
    James, I am going to Heaven, but you must continue to crawl a little
    longer in this evil world.’ And taking leave of both, he deliver’d his
    hat, wig, and clothes to Mr William Fraser, and desired him to see that
    the executioner did not touch them; he ordered his cap to be put on,
    and unloosing his neckcloth and the collar of his shirt, he kneeled
    down at the block, and pulled the cloth which was to receive his head
    close to him. But being placed too near the block, the executioner
    desired him to remove a little farther back, which, with the warders’
    assistance, was immediately done; and his neck being properly placed,
    he told the executioner he would say a short prayer, and then give the
    signal by dropping his handkerchief. In this position he remained about
    half a minute, and then, throwing his handkerchief upon the floor,
    the executioner at one blow severed his head from his body, which was
    received in the cloth, and together with his body put into the coffin,
    and carried in the hearse back to the Tower, where it remained until
    four o’clock, and was then taken away by an undertaker, in order to
    be sent to Scotland, and deposited in his own tomb in the church of
    Kirkhill; but leave not being given, as was expected, it was again
    brought back to the Tower, and interred near the bodies of the other
    lords. Lord Lovat, in a codicil to his will, had ordered that all the
    pipers from John o’ Groats to Edinburgh were to play before his corpse,
    for which they were to have a handsome allowance, and though he did
    not expect this wish to be complied with, yet he said that he hoped
    that the good old women of his country would sing a ‘coronach’ before
    him.” The legend that Lovat’s ghost, in a monk’s dress, appeared during
    a tempest with its head under its arm, probably had its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>origin in
    this desire of his to have a great Scottish wake at his funeral, and
    also to his once having worn the dress of a Jesuit priest in one of his
    adventures at St Omer; of this there is a curious contemporary print.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Lord Cromarty was pardoned, owing to the exertions of his wife, who
    petitioned every member of the Privy Council, and had fallen in a swoon
    at the feet of George <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> at Kensington, in the very act of presenting
    him with a petition for mercy. Her prayer was more graciously received
    by that sovereign than Lady Nithsdale’s petition had been by his
    father. It is said that a son born to Lady Cromarty about this time had
    the mark of an axe upon its neck.</p>

  <p>The block, now in the Armoury of the Tower, is undoubtedly the one
    upon which Lovat was beheaded, and is declared to have originally been
    made for his execution. The axe which stands beside it was used to
    behead him, as well as the other Jacobite lords who suffered death in
    1746, but whether it was used previous to these executions cannot be
    ascertained with any certainty.</p>

  <p>Although Lord Lovat was the last person beheaded in England, a peer was
    hanged at Tyburn after being imprisoned in the Tower in the last year
    of the reign of George <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> This was Lawrence Shirley, Earl Ferrers,
    who had murdered his steward, Johnson, in cold blood. Probably if
    this crime had been committed in these days Lord Ferrers would have
    benefited by a more merciful dispensation. That he had been insane on
    several occasions is certain, and he had been wilder and more reckless
    in his manner of life than could be accounted for by anything short of
    madness, his fits of wild rage clearly pointing to a disordered brain.
    He had married a harmless and amiable woman, the daughter of Sir V.
    Meredith, and she, unable to live with such a brutal husband as Ferrers
    proved himself to be, had obtained a judicial separation. Ferrers was
    wildly extravagant, and it was owing to his debts that the unfortunate
    lawyer, Johnson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> who had been appointed by a special Act of Parliament
    to manage the Shirley estates, was made the steward of the property.
    Ferrers had repeatedly sworn that he would rid himself of this agent
    and steward, and having enticed him to his house, deliberately shot the
    poor man as he knelt begging for his life. Ferrers was arrested, and
    brought to the Tower under a guard of constables. A stranger procession
    than that of Lord Ferrers to his prison can scarcely be imagined.
    He was in his own carriage, a landau drawn by six horses, and was
    dressed in “a riding frock, wearing boots, and a jockey cap.” In this
    costume he appeared before the House of Lords in February 1760. He was
    imprisoned in the Middle Tower, two warders being in an adjoining room,
    whilst two sentries kept guard at the foot of the Tower stairs. There
    he remained for the two months which elapsed before his trial. On the
    5th of May he was hanged at Tyburn, with all the pomp and circumstance
    that in those days clung to the death of a criminal if he were a
    nobleman. Being an Earl, Lord Ferrers was allowed to be strangled out
    of existence by a silken instead of a hempen rope, and although the
    sentence of his execution included the order that his body was to be
    dissected, the order was dispensed with.</p>

  <p>Lord Ferrers was taken from the Tower in his own carriage, drawn by
    six horses, to the gallows. He wore a superb dress, a pale-coloured
    silk coat edged with silver lace, and was accompanied by grenadiers,
    and horse and foot guards, his carriage being followed by some of the
    coaches of members of his family, and his hearse, which was also drawn
    by six horses. The streets were so crowded to see this unusual sight,
    that it took the procession three hours to reach Tyburn from the Tower.
    Lord Ferrers went out of the world in a far more becoming manner than
    he had lived in it. He regretted, he said, not to have been allowed
    to be executed on Tower Hill, where his ancestor, the Earl of Essex,
    had been beheaded. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>If he actually made this remark, he could not
    have been aware that his ancestor had not been beheaded on Tower Hill,
    but within the Tower walls, on the Green. To judge by his portrait,
    painted by the French portrait painter, Andran, Lord Ferrers had a
    bullet-shaped head, and must have closely resembled the ordinary type
    of jockey when he appeared in his riding-boots and jockey cap before
    his peers at his trial.</p>

    The great Spanish treasure, worth a million and a half of dollars,
    captured by Lord Anson, with his ship, the <cite>Centurion</cite>, on the

  <div class="subheadc">GEORGE <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first political prisoner to enter the Tower in the reign of George
    the Third was John Wilkes, the notorious member for Middlesex. On the
    30th of April 1763, Wilkes was imprisoned in the Tower under a warrant
    signed by Lords Egremont and Halifax, the charge against him being,
    that he had written and published the <cite>North Briton</cite> newspaper,
    the forty-fifth number of which was styled “a most infamous and
    seditious libel.” Wilkes, however, was only kept for a week in the
    fortress, the Lord Chief-Justice (afterwards Lord Camden) deciding that
    the offence for which he was committed to prison, “was not an offence
    sufficient to destroy the privilege of a member of Parliament, that it
    was unconstitutional, illegal, and absolutely void.”</p>

  <p>The next prisoners of note also made the acquaintance of the inside of
    the fortress indirectly through the Press. They were no less personages
    than the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Brass Crosby, and one of his
    Aldermen, Oliver, both members of Parliament. They had held a messenger
    to bail, who, under the Speaker’s warrant, had apprehended the printers
    of the <cite>London Evening Post</cite>, and had afterwards been charged by
    the arrested printer with assault and false imprisonment. The Lord
    Mayor and his Alderman attempted to justify themselves before the House
    of Commons by claiming the City privileges,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>nevertheless,
    they were kept in durance vile in the Tower until the 23rd of July,
    when, Parliament being prorogued, they obtained their liberty, after a
    confinement of four months’ duration. Their liberation was regarded as
    a popular triumph, and celebrated with much rejoicing.</p>

  <p>During the American War many of the Tower guns, and a quantity of the
    ammunition stored there, was sent across the Atlantic, and used against
    the so-called “rebellious colonists.”</p>

  <p>In June 1780, that half-crazed fanatic, Lord George Gordon, was a
    prisoner in the Tower, charged with the instigation of the “No Popery”
    riots, which for a time had placed London in peril of mob-rule, and
    caused great loss of life and property by fire and pillage. After a
    trial which lasted twenty-one hours, Lord George was declared not
    guilty. A few years later, however, he was doomed to end his life in
    Newgate prison. At the same time that Lord George was a prisoner in the
    fortress, the Earl of Pomfret was committed there for having challenged
    the Duke of Grafton to fight a duel. In the following year a French
    spy, named Henry Francis de la Motte, was in the Tower on a charge of
    high treason. He was found guilty, and hanged at Tyburn on the 23rd
    of July. In 1794 the coalition between Pitt and the Whigs took place,
    and soon afterwards Pitt carried two Bills through Parliament, one
    of which was to the effect that mere writing, speaking, or preaching
    against the King’s authority was tantamount to treason; the other
    forbade all political meetings, unless advertised beforehand, and
    permitted their dispersal by any two justices of the peace. These very
    coercive measures over-reached themselves, and juries would not convict
    persons charged with offences under their clauses. Horne Tooke, “Parson
    Tooke,” as he was familiarly called, the celebrated wit, was the most
    brilliant of a set who desired more civil and religious liberty in
    England, and with this object they formed themselves into a society for
    the propaganda of their opinions, holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> meetings, and making use of
    existing societies, clubs, and associations. Tooke, Jeremiah Joyce,
    a clergyman, and private secretary to Lord Stanhope, Thomas Hardy,
    a shoemaker, John Thelwall, Bonney, Richter, and Lovatt, were all
    arrested and placed in the Tower, and brought before the Privy Council
    on a charge of high treason. These so-called reformers were eight
    weeks in the fortress. At length the trials took place, Hardy being
    acquitted, to the great delight of the populace, the reformer shoemaker
    becoming the hero of the hour. Tooke was tried at the Old Bailey, and
    he also was acquitted, as were the rest of the prisoners. In 1798,
    Arthur O’Connor, the editor of the <cite>Press</cite>, an Irish Nationalist
    newspaper, with John Alley, John Burns, and James O’Coighley were
    placed in the fortress on a charge of maintaining a traitorous
    correspondence with the French Directory. O’Connor and his companions,
    it seems, had been entrusted by the Society of the United Irishmen with
    a mission to the French Directory in the month of March 1798, but on
    their way to Paris they were arrested at Margate by Bow Street runners,
    although they had bribed a fisherman with £150 to take them across
    the Channel. On their luggage being searched, uniforms, arms, and a
    large sum of money were found. They were immediately brought back to
    London, and lodged in separate prisons in the Tower, but the trial was
    held at Margate, and James O’Coighley, who seems to have been made the
    scapegoat, was hanged on Pennenden Heath. Lord Thanet, who was a friend
    of O’Connor’s, was present at the latter’s trial at Maidstone, and with
    him were Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Sir Francis Burdett, and Samuel
    Whitbread. During the trial O’Connor made a bolt for freedom, springing
    out of the dock, and forcing his way through the court; he almost
    succeeded in escaping. A free fight ensued, and in the <i lang="fr">melée</i>
    Lord Thanet was arrested, and on the charge of aiding and abetting the
    prisoner O’Connor to escape, and with resisting the officers of the
    law, was sent off to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>Tower. At his trial Lord Thanet remarked
    that, “he thought it only fair that O’Connor should have a run for it.”
    Lord Thanet was tried at the Court of King’s Bench in May 1799, and
    with him a barrister named Ferguson, who had also shown his sympathy
    with O’Connor during his trial. Both were found guilty. Lord Thanet
    was fined £1000, and sentenced to be imprisoned in the Tower for
    twelve months; Ferguson had to pay a fine of £500, and was ordered to
    be imprisoned in the King’s Bench prison. Sackville Tufton, Earl of
    Thanet, was the last peer who was imprisoned in the Tower.</p>

  <p>Ten years after this another prisoner was brought to the Tower amidst
    wild scenes of popular excitement, such as the old fortress had not
    witnessed since the mob led by Wat Tyler had surged about its grey
    walls. This prisoner was Sir Francis Burdett, who was sent to the Tower
    on the 10th of April 1810, for an alleged libel on the House of Commons
    in a letter addressed to his constituents, the electors of Westminster,
    which had appeared in Cobbet’s “Political Register.” In this letter
    Sir Francis denied the power of the House of Commons to imprison
    delinquents, and this statement was voted by the House to be “libellous
    and scandalous.” Burdett had made himself obnoxious to the Ministers
    of his day by his strong Liberal politics, and they at once made this
    letter an excuse for venting their hatred upon him. The House of
    Commons during an all-night sitting passed an order for his attachment,
    and a warrant was drawn up and signed by Speaker Abbot to arrest
    the too popular baronet, and place him in the Tower. For some days
    Burdett refused to comply with the Speaker’s warrant, and the longer
    he refused to be arrested the greater became the excitement throughout
    London. Free fights took place between the military and the mob, the
    windows of the Tory Ministers’ houses were smashed, and the electors
    of Westminster mustered round Sir Francis’s house in Piccadilly (that
    now occupied by his noble-hearted and charitable daughter the Baroness
    BurdettCoutts)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> in their thousands. These protested their devotion to
    their beloved member, and their determination to prevent his being
    taken to prison. At length Burdett was obliged to surrender to the
    officers, who forced their way into his drawing-room, and being placed
    in a coach, was driven by way of the north of London, by Moorfields and
    the Minories, to the Tower. On Tower Hill the mob seemed inclined to
    attempt a rescue, but fortunately no conflict occurred, and Sir Francis
    was safely conducted to his prison, in a house near to that occupied
    by Colonel Mathew Smith, who was acting in the place of the Lieutenant
    of the Tower, General Vernon, the latter being too infirm to attend to
    his duties. Lord Moira, the Constable of the Tower, was present when
    Sir Francis arrived at the fortress. As the soldiers who had escorted
    the Liberal member for Westminster to the Tower were returning to their
    quarters there was a collision between them and the mob, and on Tower
    Hill the military were obliged to charge the people, many being killed;
    two more people were killed in Fenchurch Street, whilst riots broke out
    in several places in the metropolis. Burdett’s imprisonment lasted for
    ten weeks, he being set at liberty when Parliament was prorogued on the
    21st of June. In order to avoid a fresh demonstration he was taken down
    the river to his villa at Wimbledon. In later years Sir Francis changed
    his politics and became a steady Whig, but for thirty years he was the
    most popular member of Parliament that ever sat for Westminster.</p>

  <p>Ten years again elapsed before the Tower opened its gates to receive
    prisoners, these being Thistlewood, with his crew of cut-throats,
    Ings, Harrison, Davidson, Wilson, Tidd Kamment, and Brunt, who were
    imprisoned in the fortress in 1820, for plotting to assassinate the
    members of the Cabinet whilst they were dining at Lord Harrowby’s
    in Grosvenor Square. This was the plot known as the Cato Street
    Conspiracy, from the meeting-place of this band of desperadoes being
    in a house in that street, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>where they were taken after a stubborn
    resistance. Thistlewood was imprisoned in the Bloody Tower, and was
    the last prisoner to occupy its gloomy dungeon, for with him and his
    associates the Tower ceased to be a prison of State, and it is to be
    hoped will ever remain so. Ings and Davidson were placed in St Thomas’s
    Tower; the others in the Byward, Middle and Salt Towers. Thistlewood
    and five others were hanged in front of Newgate; the remainder were
    sentenced to transportation for life.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE LATE REIGNS</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> the late reigns there is little that calls for record in the
    history of the Tower: happy is the land that has no history. But for
    the fire in 1841, which destroyed the ugly old Armoury of William
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>’s time, and the dastardly attempt made in 1885 to blow up the
    White Tower, no events of much interest have happened. The old
    fortress, however, has undergone much structural alterations and needed
    restoration, in which, although great mistakes have been made, as must
    inevitably be the case when such a group of old buildings as those in
    the Tower are touched, the result, on the whole, has benefited the
    appearance of the fortress, and above all, aided the preservation for
    future ages of the noblest and most historical group of buildings that
    exists in our land. May they endure: may they be venerated by future
    generations of our race as they deserve to be.</p>

  <p>The following narratives concern the two events just named.</p>

  <h3 class="smcap" id="THE_FIRE">The Fire of 1841</h3>

  <p>On the night of Saturday, the 30th of October 1841, the great Armoury,
    or storehouse, to the east of St Peter’s Chapel, was completely gutted.
    The fire broke out in the Bowyer Tower, which abutted on the Armoury;
    an overheated flue in a stove is supposed to have been the cause. The
    Armoury had been commenced in the reign of James <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span><abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and completed
    in the reign of William and Mary, to whom, when it was finished, a
    banquet had been given in the great hall of the building. This hall,
    which occupied the whole length of the first floor, was afterwards used
    as a storehouse for small arms, 150,000 stands of which were destroyed
    by the fire; besides these, were numbers of cannon and trophies taken
    in the field. The loss caused by the conflagration was estimated at
    £200,000. The Regalia was saved from the Martin Tower by one of the
    superintendents of the Metropolitan police, named Pierce, an incident
    of bravery which Cruikshank perpetuated in one of his finest etchings.
    Accompanied by the Keeper of the Jewels and his wife, Pierce, with
    some other officials, broke the bars of the cage behind which the
    Royal jewels were kept, with crowbars, and then at great personal risk
    he managed to squeeze himself through the narrow opening thus made,
    handing out the crown, orb, and sceptre to those outside. The silver
    font was too large to pass through the opening, and it was necessary to
    break away another bar of the grating. Repeated cries from the outside
    now warned the party to leave the Jewel Room, as the fire was rapidly
    gaining upon the tower, but Pierce remained until he had secured the
    whole of the Regalia. The heat inside was so intense that some of the
    cloth upon which the Crown jewels rested was charred. “Some public
    reward to Mr Pierce,” writes Chamber, in his “Book of Days,” “who had
    so gallantly imperilled himself to save the Regalia of the United
    Kingdom, would have been a fitting tribute to his bravery. But no such
    recompense was ever bestowed.”</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Sketch of the Fire at the Tower in 1841.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>A contemporary account of the disaster in George Cruikshank’s
    <cite>Omnibus</cite>, edited by Laman Blanchard, gives the following
    description of the destruction of the Armoury:—“There stood the keeper
    himself, his wife at his side, partaking the peril; and the warders
    whom he had summoned to the rescue. We must, however, pourtray the
    stifling heat and smoke; the clamour of the soldiers outside the
    closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> portal, which the fires of the Armoury were striving to reach;
    nor the roar of the still excluded flames, the clang of the pumps,
    the hissing of the water-pipes, the gathering feet and voices of the
    multitude. They are beyond the pencil. The pressure from without
    increased. Again the clamours rose high, and the furnace heat rose
    higher. But the keeper abided his time—the crowbars were raised in a
    dozen hands awaiting his word. It was given! The first blow since the
    days of King Charles descended on the iron fence; and Queen Victoria’s
    crown safely deposited in its case, and sheltered therein from smoke
    and flame, and the common gaze, was removed to the Governor’s house.
    Orbs, diadems, and sceptres—dishes, flagons, and chalices—the services
    of court and of church, of altar and of banquet, were sent forth in
    the care of many a sturdy warder, gallant John Lund being the leader.
    The huge baptismal font, soon to be called into use for the Prince of
    Wales, was last removed. The Jewel Room was as bare as if Blood the
    First had left nought behind him for Blood the Second. How must the
    spectators have gazed on the bright procession, as from window, and
    roof, and turret, the Armoury blazed out upon it!... Next in sublimity
    to the spectacle of the blazing pile, was the scene afterwards
    presented, when, as the fire lessened, and the smoke cleared off, the
    whole space of the enormous armoury was opened to the straining eye—a
    sight of awe and wonder. Above was the sky of a November morn, and
    below, covering the immense sweep of the floor, heaps of fused metal,
    of dimensions scarce to be credited, with bayonet points bristling up
    everywhere, close-set and countless, like long blades of grass.”</p>

  <p>The buildings destroyed in the fire were the Armoury, a hideous William
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> building, the upper part of the Bowyer or Chevener Tower, which
    was also hideous and modern. The only relic of much interest destroyed
    in the Armoury was the wheel of Nelson’s ship <cite>Victory</cite>; the arms
    destroyed were modern, and were all soon replaced.</p>

  <p>The present Gothic barracks were built upon the site of the Armoury,
    and were opened in some state in 1845 by the great Duke of Wellington,
    who was then Constable of the Tower. These barracks, which were
    completed in 1849, were named after the Duke; they are loopholed
    for musketry, and will hold 1000 men. North-east of the White Tower
    is a modern castellated building which is used by the officers of
    the garrison; further to the south-east are the Ordnance Office and
    Storehouses. The area of the Tower within the walls is twelve acres and
    a few poles, and the circuit outside the moat is one thousand and fifty
    yards.</p>

  <h3 class="smcap" id="THE_FENIAN">The Fenian Attempt to blow up the White Tower on the 24th of
    January 1885</h3>

  <p>Three explosions took place in London on Saturday, the 24th of January
    1885, during what the Irish Fenians called the “Dynamite War.” Two of
    these occurred in the Houses of Parliament, the third in the White
    Tower.</p>

  <p>The mine, or rather, infernal machine, was laid in the Armoury, and was
    placed between the stands of arms in the Banqueting Room, both that
    chamber and the Council Room being injured by the explosion.</p>

  <p>Saturday being one of the days upon which the Tower is free to
    visitors, the old building was full of people, the Banqueting Room
    being well filled with women and children when the explosion took
    place, at two o’clock—the same time as that at which the explosion
    at the House of Parliament occurred. The cries of the people in the
    room were most distressing, and immediately the charge exploded, the
    Banqueting Room was ablaze, the flames communicating themselves to the
    floor above. Since the fire in the Tower in 1841, a fire brigade had
    been stationed in the building, and numerous fire extinguishers, such
    as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> small manuals and hydrants, were kept in readiness, and although
    two of the London fire brigades were telephoned for, the military, with
    the aid of hoses and hydrants, had already checked the spreading of the
    flames. The actual amount of damage done, happily, fell far short of
    what might have been expected, considering the force of the explosion,
    and the great age of the building attacked. The windows and casements
    were nearly all blown out, the flagstaff at the top of the White Tower
    was blown away, the floor was burnt, and the face of the clock was
    damaged; and this was the extent of the hurt caused by the dastardly
    attempt to wreck the White Tower. The report of the explosion is
    described as being like the firing of a heavy piece of artillery, being
    followed by a flame of fire that rose up through the open well that
    communicates between the second and third floors in the centre of the
    two halls. This flame was immediately succeeded by a shivering of all
    the glass in the windows, the crashing of the woodwork, and the falling
    of hundreds of rifles from the armoury racks, while a dense cloud of
    dust darkened the interior of the building, and made it impossible for
    the visitors or officials to discover where the explosion had occurred.
    A wild panic ensued, and as the dust gradually cleared away, the people
    rushed in a wild helter-skelter down the staircase, and poured out of
    the Tower. Meanwhile, the warders and police arrived to the succour
    of the injured, whom they had to draw out from beneath the wreckage.
    Directly after the explosion the bugles sounded the assembly, and the
    Grenadiers, who formed the garrison, turned out. Lord Chelmsford, the
    Lieutenant of the Tower, and General Milman, its Major, caused flying
    sentries to be posted at every avenue and point of egress admitting to
    the Tower. Orders were given to close the gates, and no one was to be
    allowed to leave the fortress under any pretext. The perpetrator of
    the outrage was a scoundrel, who, two years before, had been concerned
    in the outrage of a similar nature on the Underground <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>Railway, when
    bombs had been placed at Charing Cross and Praed Street stations. He
    was sentenced to fourteen years’ penal servitude with hard labour, and
    was released in the month of March 1899. That the White Tower escaped,
    and the people in it, with so little injury, was a miracle, for the
    charge of dynamite was a strong one.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Crime, like history, repeats itself. Amongst the manuscripts kept at
    Hatfield House is the following declaration:—</p>

  <p>“1593–4 Feb. 6. John Danyell, Irishman, came to me, Richard Young,
    the 6th day of February 1593, and gave me to understand of a plot
    that is pretended for the firing of the Tower—viz. that there is a
    vault wherein brimstone doth lie, and there is gunpowder under it. And
    he says that there is a trap door that doth stand much open, and is
    purposed that two men like labourers shall come in as though they were
    workmen in the Tower, and shall cast certain balls into the vault where
    the brimstone lieth, and in a short time it will take fire and consume
    all.”</p>

  <p>From this it will be seen that the intention of one criminal in the
    reign of Queen Elizabeth was carried out by another nearly three
    hundred years later, in the reign of Queen Victoria.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subhead">DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CITY OF LONDON AND THE OFFICIALS OF THE TOWER
    AS TO THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE TOWER</div>

  <p>“This dispute as to the Liberties and Privileges of the Tower began as
    early as 1465–66, the fifth of Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> Early in Queen Elizabeth’s
    reign it was renewed; the points of controversy are referred to in the
    above letter (a letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council
    complaining of the conduct of Sir William George, Porter of the Tower
    of London, regarding his usurpation of the Liberties and Franchises of
    the City by ‘compelling poor victuallers strangers, coming to London
    by ship or boat with fish, fruit, or such victuals, to give him such
    a quantity as pleased him to take, as two or three cod-fish from each
    boat, etc., without payment. Such as refused he caused to be imprisoned
    in the Tower, whereby the victuallers were discouraged to come to the
    City, and their number decreased, to the great hurt of the markets
    and the victualling of the City, especially at this present time of
    Lent’). The Council referred the question to the consideration of the
    Lord Chief-Justice of the Queen’s Bench (Sir Christopher Wray), the
    Lord Chief of the Common Pleas (Sir Edward Anderson), and the Master
    of the Rolls (Sir Gilbert Gerard), who gave their opinion upon some of
    the privileges claimed by the Lieutenant, but not upon the question of
    boundaries. They reported with respect to the claims of freedom from
    arrest by action in the City, and protections granted by the Lieutenant
    to officers and attendants in the Tower, and not obeying writs of
    <i lang="la">habeas corpus</i>; that in their opinion, persons daily attendant in
    the Tower, and serving the Queen there, should be privileged, and not
    arrested on any plaint in London, but this should not apply to writs
    of execution or <i lang="la">capias utlagatum</i>; that the Lieutenant ought to
    return every <i lang="la">habeas corpus</i> out of any court at Westminster, so
    that the justices before whom it should be returned might either remand
    it with the body, or retain the matter before them, and deliver the
    body. They further gave their opinion that the claim of the Lieutenant,
    that if a person privileged in the Tower were arrested in London, he
    might detain any citizen found within the Tower until the other was
    delivered, was altogether against the laws of the realm. The Lords of
    the Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> made an order settling these controversies, which was
    dated from Nonsuch, October 3rd, 1585. The question of boundaries
    still remained in dispute. Stowe quotes documents, which he says he
    had seen among the Records in the Tower, from which it would appear
    that the bounds in controversy were at Little Tower Hill, the Postern,
    and East Smithfield on one side, and on the other the extent of Tower
    Hill, and towards Barking Church. The City claimed the Postern Gate
    in the end of the London Wall by the Tower, and houses built near to
    the Wall and Postern; all the void ground within the Postern Gate—viz.
    the whole hill and ground where the scaffold for the execution of
    traitors stood, and where the Sheriffs of London received prisoners
    from the Tower to be executed (from which place the boundary stone had
    been removed), with the Watergate and the gardens under the London
    Wall. The City also claimed that the whole ground and soil called
    Tower Hill without the Postern Gate, being parcel of East Smithfield,
    was theirs. They likewise objected to the Lieutenant holding pleas
    in the court of the Tower, that being only a Court Baron, and not a
    Court of Record; also to the exactions taken in the name of prizage of
    victuallers bringing victuals, fuel, and other things by water. The
    Lieutenant disputed the original position of the Postern in question,
    and asserted that the City’s proofs brought from their own manuscripts,
    etc., were insufficient to dispossess any subject, much less the King.
    He also submitted the presentment made by an inquest held anno 27
    Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, before Sir Anthony (William) Kingston, High Constable of
    the Tower, which stated that the bounds began ‘at the Watergate next
    the Ramshead, in Petty Wales; and so streyched North unto a Mudwall
    called Pykes Garden, on this side of Crutched Friars; and so strait
    East unto the Wall of London, with nine gardens above the Postern, and
    above the <cite>Broken Tower</cite>, right unto the midst of Hog Lane End,
    and so strait unto the Thames, and so six foot without the Stairs at
    the East-gate of the Tower towards St Katherine’s.’ In the reign of
    King James the Second the subject was again before the Privy Council,
    who on the 12th May 1686, directed the boundaries to be ascertained,
    which was done, and the broad arrow in iron, with the date, set on
    the houses. On the 13th October in the same year a warrant was issued
    by King James the Second, for a charter to be prepared for confirming
    the same. This Charter, dated 10th June 1687, exempted the limits
    defined in the schedule (and which were practically those claimed by
    the Lieutenant) from the jurisdiction of the City, and of the Justices,
    etc., of Middlesex; directed that the Governor of the Tower, or his
    deputies, should execute and return all writs, processes, etc., within
    the limits; that a Session of the Peace should be held four times a
    year within the Liberty of the Tower, and that the Justices of the
    Peace should have power to commit traitors, felons, etc., to Newgate.
    It also established a Court of Record within the Liberties, the Steward
    of the Court being the Coroner, the Governor of the Tower having the
    appointment of the officers. Whilst the duties of the Justices of the
    Peace, as defined by the charter, have been from time to time added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> to
    by the Acts 13 George <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> cap. 19. sec. 7, 37 George <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> cap. 25, sec.
    13–16, and by sundry licensing Acts, their powers have been limited by
    the Police Act (10 George <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> cap. 44) and supplementary Police Acts.
    The Central Criminal Court Act, 4 and 5 William <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> cap. 36, included
    the Liberty of the Tower within the jurisdiction of that Court, and
    took away the power of its Justices to try at their Sessions offences
    under the Act. This, however, has been somewhat modified by subsequent
    Acts.”</p>

  <p class="center">The<br />
    Behaviour and Character<br />
    of the<br />
    Three Highlanders,<br />
    Who were Shot, on July 18th, 1743.</p>

  <p>The many inconsistent and scandalous Reports that are spread about
    Town, both in Print and Conversation, concerning the Characters and
    Behaviour of the three unhappy young Men who suffer’d in the Tower
    of <em>London</em> on <em>Monday</em> the 18th of <em>July</em>, make it
    necessary as well for Information of the Public, as out of Charity to
    their Memories, to publish the following Sheets.</p>

  <p>The Author of this Tract thinks it necessary to premise, that he means
    not in the Relation he intends to make of this Affair, either to
    justify the Crime for which these Men suffer’d; or, in the least, to
    arraign the Justice of the Court-Martial in their Proceedings; or tax
    the Sentence with Severity; but, from a Motive of Christian Charity and
    Love for Truth, means to remove from the Character of the Deceased,
    such false Aspersions as are cast upon them, either by the Malice or
    Ignorance of some, who think it not only necessary for the Vindication
    of public Justice, to represent these unhappy Men as Mutineers and
    Deserters, but must paint them as Men void of every other Virtue, and
    addicted to the grossest Vices.</p>

  <p>In order to give the Reader a just Idea of this Corps of Men, it will
    not be improper to go back as far as their original Institution, by
    which we shall be the better enabled to form a just Notion of their
    Character.</p>

  <p>Few that are in the least acquainted with the History or Constitution
    of <em>Scotland</em> but know, that anciently all the Lands in that
    Kingdom were held of the Crown by Military Tenures, or Knights Service;
    and that the Vassals of these great Men held their Lands of them by the
    same kind of Tenures.</p>

  <p>By this Means, the Nobility of that Kingdom had always a Number
    of Men ready to bring into the Field, either in defence of their
    <em>Sovereign</em>, or to decide their own private Quarrels with one
    another, at which the Crown always conniv’d (for political Reasons)
    until both Parties were reduced to an equal and moderate Share of Power.</p>

  <p>This Practice of Subjects deciding their private Quarrels by the
    Sword, obtained anciently all over <em>Britain</em> and most other
    Countries, until Civil Polity and more wholesome Laws prevailed: and
    still remained in the <em>South</em> parts, and towards the Borders of
    <em>Scotland</em>, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> near the Time of the Union of the Crowns in the
    Person of King <em>James</em> the First, when the chief Men in those
    Parts were diverted from their private Animosities, by their necessary
    Attendance on the Court, now removed at a greater Distance from them.</p>

  <p>However, this Spirit of Family Feuds still prevailed in the
    <em>Highlands</em>, and more remote Parts of <em>Scotland</em>, who, by
    their Distance from the Court, were unacquainted with the Manners of
    the civiliz’d Part of the Nation.</p>

  <p>The inferior Chieftains in these Parts still determined their mutual
    Quarrels as usual: and in revenge of any Affront, made Incursions and
    Depredations into the Estates of one another, or connived at their
    Followers doing so, to the great Discouragement of Industry, and
    Disturbance of the public Peace.</p>

  <p>In this Situation were Things in that Part of the Country about the
    Time of the Union of the Kingdoms, when the Government very wisely,
    by the Act called the <cite>Clan-Act</cite>, abolished these Tenures, and
    for preventing these Depredations last mentioned, raised several
    Independent Companies in the <em>Highlands</em>, the command of which
    were given to some of the most considerable Gentlemen in that Corner,
    such as Lord <em>Loveat</em>, Laird of <em>Grant</em>, <em>Lochnell</em>,
    <em>Farah</em>, etc., all men of Distinction and Weight, who were willing
    to engage their Personal and Family Influence, as well as that of their
    Companies, for suppressing those Quarrels, and settling a Civil Polity
    in the Country.</p>

  <p>When this Levy was made, the Officers took a special Care that none
    should be enlisted into that Service, but the Sons of the wealthiest
    and most reputable Farmers in the Country; and the second and younger
    Sons of some of the lesser Vassals were not asham’d to enlist in a
    service calculated for restoring of Peace, and establishing Liberty and
    Property in their Country. And as they were allowed to occupy their own
    Farms or follow any other Occupation, except upon Muster-Days, or when
    they were actually employed in pursuit of Robbers, or Disturbers of the
    public Peace; they, instead of receiving Bounty-Money, made Interest
    with the Officer to be admitted.</p>

  <p>In this Shape they continued till they were Regimented, under the
    Command of the Honourable the Earl of <em>Crawford</em>, a Nobleman,
    whose Character was every way agreeable to them, and made little or no
    Alteration in their Circumstances.</p>

  <p>When we have taken this View of their Original and History, down to the
    Period of their being Regimented, it will be no Matter of Surprize to
    find the private Men of that Regiment differing much in their Manners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
    from those of other Corps, if we consider that when they entered the
    Service it was impossible for them to have the least Apprehensions of
    ever being obliged to leave their own Country where most of them had
    Farms or other Concerns, and looked upon themselves, and I believe were
    esteemed by the Country, only as a regulated Militia, at least till
    such Time as they were Regimented, which was only a few Years ago.</p>

  <p>The Earl of <em>Crawford</em> enjoyed that Regiment but a short time,
    when it was given to their present Colonel the Honourable Lord
    <em>Semple</em>.</p>

  <p>They were quartered last year, the one half of them at
    <em>Inverness</em>, and the other at <em>Perth</em>; some Time in Spring
    the Regiment was informed by their officers that they were to be
    reviewed at <em>Musselburgh</em>, a village within four miles of
    <em>Edinburgh</em>, and afterwards to return to their quarters.</p>

  <p>Accordingly they had a Rout given them to that place, and arrived
    there; but were told they were not to be reviewed there, but at
    <em>Berwick</em> upon <em>Tweed</em>; when they came to this place, they
    were told that his Majesty designed to review them in Person at
    <em>London</em>, and that then they would all return to their Families.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at <em>London</em>, and found that his Majesty was
    gone, the Regiment were universally dissatisfied, that after so long
    a March they were disappointed of the Honour of being reviewed by his
    Majesty.</p>

  <p>Some Time after their coming here a Report was currently spread that
    the Regiment was to be sent to some Parts of the <em>West-Indies</em>,
    and broke or divided amongst the Colonies; which raised in the private
    Men, who believed this Report, a very great Animosity against their
    Officers, whom they groundlessly blamed for not informing them truly
    where they were to go before they carried them from their own Country;
    and not allowing them Time to settle their Concerns, of which some had
    very considerable, which they were obliged to leave in great Disorder,
    they thought the Interest of the Government did no ways require
    that they, more than any other Regiment in <em>Britain</em> should be
    left ignorant of the Rout they were to take, and by that means be
    disappointed of an Opportunity of settling their private affairs in
    a manner suitable to so long an Absence; that they had been so long
    settled in that Country without any View of being so suddenly called
    from it, that it amounted to as great a Hardship on them (comparatively
    speaking) as it would be to the Militia of the City of <em>London</em> to
    be shipped for the <em>Indies</em> on an Hour’s Warning.</p>

  <p>The Officers took pains to allay this flame, by assuring the Men that
    so soon as the Review was over they would be allowed to return Home.</p>

  <p>But when the Report of their Embarkation prevailed, they were out
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> all Patience, and looked upon the Design of sending them to
    <em>Flanders</em> only as a Blind to get them on board, in order to ship
    them really for the <em>West-Indies</em>.</p>

  <p>Tho’ their Officers attempted to undeceive them, yet they had been
    disappointed so often, and filled so long with Hopes of going Home,
    that they had no Credit with them.</p>

  <p>Add to this, that there was another Complaint pretended for the
    Ground of their Discontent, that some small Arrears were due to them,
    that they had all been obliged to use their own Swords, and that
    their Cloathing, especially their Shoes and Plaids, were remarkably
    deficient, these last not being worth Six-pence <i>per</i> Yard;
    whereas they used to be allowed Plaids of more than double that Value.</p>

  <p>This Spirit continued after the Review, when the Discontented agreed
    upon <em>Tuesday</em> Night after to meet at <em>Finchley Common</em>,
    where a great Number of them convened and waited till their Number
    increased. In this interval some of their Officers came up, and by
    their persuasions a great Number returned; However, about a 100 of them
    continued their first Resolution of returning to their own Country.</p>

  <p>Here it is remarkable that the Night was so dark that they scarce could
    distinguish Faces, or make any Computation of their Number, and that
    <em>Malcolm M‘Pherson</em>, one of the Deceased had never hitherto given
    any Consent to go away, but came within some Distance of the Place
    where the Men were assembled, and with another in Company, continued
    irresolute what Course to take until the coming up of the Officers had
    raised some Ferment, upon which he came into the Crowd, and allowed
    himself to be hurried along without knowing where he was going.</p>

  <p>Next Morning when by Day-Light they could discern their Number, and
    not finding the Desertion so general as they expected, <em>Samuel
    M‘Pherson</em>, another of the Deceased, advised the whole Body
    strenuously to return to their Duty, which Advice he continued to
    inculcate during their March to <em>Lady Wood</em>; and in a short Time
    after they came there, he applied to a Justice of the Peace to propose
    terms of surrender; and during all their Stay there, used his utmost
    Endeavours to prevent Things coming to the last Extremity.</p>

  <p>At last being in some Hopes of a Pardon by the Intervention of his
    Grace the Duke of <em>Montague</em>, to whom Application was made in
    their behalf, they surrendered on Discretion, in which <em>Samuel
    M‘Pherson</em> was the most instrumental, as will be acknowledged by the
    Officers to whom he surrendered.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

  <p>They were brought soon after to the Tower, and a Court Martial
    appointed to try them.</p>

  <p>The first Day the Court Martial sat, a Person, a Stranger to all the
    Prisoners, came to the Grate, and pretending a great deal of Concern
    for their Misfortunes, advised them not to mention on their Trial any
    complaint they might have against their Officers, intimating, that he
    was certain such a Plea would not avail them, and without serving them
    would expose their Officers.</p>

  <p>That the wisest Course they could follow for their own Safety, would
    be to acknowledge their Guilt, and plead mercy of the Court Martial,
    which he assured them would effectually work their Deliverance that no
    Punishment would be inflicted on them, and at the same Time presented
    them with a Petition which he had already drawn, addressed to the
    Court Martial in these terms, and they very frankly relying on these
    assurances signed and delivered the same to that honourable Court.</p>

  <p>One of their Officers came next day to the Tower, and inculcated the
    same Doctrine into the Prisoners that the Stranger had done before,
    assuring them that they would all be liberate in a short time, when all
    Justice should be done them.</p>

  <p>The Prisoners were examined before the Court Martial one by one; the
    Questions asked them were to this Purpose, Was you enlisted? Have you
    taken the Oaths? Have you received your Pay? Had you your Cloathing
    regularly? To all which they answered in the Affirmative: They were
    asked if they had any Complaints against their Officers, they all
    answered in the Negative, and in general pleaded nothing in Alleviation
    of their Crime before the Court Martial, but Inadvertency, and that
    they were moved to it by a Report which prevailed of their being sent
    to the <em>West-Indies</em>, and into a Climate destructive of their Health.</p>

  <p>I cannot help in this Place to take notice of the remarkable
    Officiousness of this Stranger. He takes upon him without being asked,
    or the least apparent Interest in the Prisoners, to advise them in
    Matters of the last Consequence to them, their Lives and Reputation;
    has the Rashness to prejudge the Opinion of the Honourable the Court
    Martial in a Point of Law, which is at least a moot Point amongst the
    Lawyers themselves.</p>

  <p>How unreasonable was it for any Man to pretend to determine what Weight
    any Plea would have before a Court of Judicature determining in a Case
    of Life and Death; and how unjust to the Prisoners, to advise them to
    conceal any Circumstance in their Case that might have the smallest
    Tendency towards alleviating their Crimes, or raising the smallest
    Motions of Compassion towards them in the Breasts of their Judges!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

  <p>Suppose there had been but little Weight in the Plea of their Want
    of Pay, yet still it was a Circumstance closely connected with their
    Crime, without which it was impossible to form a just Judgment of the
    Heinousness of that Action. For it must be granted on the one hand,
    that a Soldier who deserts and cannot plead Want of Pay, etc., is less
    excusable, and consequently deserves a greater Degree of Punishment
    than he who has such a Pretence; this must be granted, tho’ it should
    be admitted on the other hand, that there is not so much in this Plea,
    as to skreen the Criminals totally from Punishment; But how much, or
    little is in it, is a Case few wise Men will determine dogmatically,
    especially against the Prisoner, since History, either antient or
    modern, does not afford any one Instance of Capital Punishments
    inflicted on Soldiers who mutinied for Want of Pay.</p>

  <p>It is true, the Pay they want is but small; by their own Account ten or
    twelve shillings, some less, some a trifle more, which I mention out
    of Justice to the Officers, because it was currently reported in Town
    that the Deficiency was much more considerable. But however trifling
    this and their other Complaints may seem to Men not concerned, yet I
    cannot but reckon it barbarous to have advised them to conceal these
    Circumstances, the Relation of which could not be supposed to have been
    capable of making the Court Martial less merciful to the Prisoners, if
    it had not the contrary effect.</p>

  <p>But however that Plea was waved, and did not fall under the cognizance
    of the Court Martial who made their Report, the Consequence of which
    was, that on <em>Tuesday</em> the 12th, a Warrant was directed by their
    Excellencies the Lords of the Regency to the Governor of the Tower, for
    the Execution of <em>Samuel M‘Pherson</em>, <em>Malcolm M‘Pherson</em>,
    both Corporals, and <em>Farquar Shaw</em>, a private Centinel, all
    three of the Number of the Deserters, upon <em>Monday</em> the 18th of
    <em>July</em> last.</p>

  <p>Having thus impartially traced this Meeting from its Rise to this
    Period, it remains that we give some Account of the Character and
    Behaviour of these three unfortunate Criminals from the Intimation of
    their Sentence to their Execution.</p>

  <p><em>Samuel M‘Pherson</em>, aged about twenty-nine Years, unmarried,
    was born in the Parish of <em>Laggan</em> in <em>Badenuck</em> and
    Shire of <em>Inverness</em>; his Father still living, is Brother to
    <em>M‘Pherson</em> of <em>Breachie</em>, a Gentleman of a considerable
    Estate in that County, and is himself a Man of unblemished Reputation,
    and a plentiful Fortune.</p>

  <p><em>Samuel</em> was the only Son of a first Marriage, and received a
    genteel Education, having made some Progress in the Languages, and
    studied for some Time at <em>Edinburgh</em> with a Writer (that is, an
    Attorney), until about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> six Years ago he enlisted as a Volunteer in
    Major <em>Grant’s</em> Company, where he was much respected both by the
    Officers and private men, and was in a short Time made a Corporal.</p>

  <p><em>Malcolm M‘Pherson</em>, aged about 30 Years, and unmarried, was
    likewise born in the same Parish of <em>Laggan</em>, was Son of Angus
    <em>M‘Pherson</em> of <em>Driminard</em>, a Gentleman of Credit and Repute,
    who bestowed upon <em>Malcolm</em> such Education as that Part of the
    Country would afford. He enlisted about seven Years ago in my Lord
    <em>Loveat’s</em> Company, where his Behaviour recommended him to the
    Esteem of his Officers, and was soon made a Corporal.</p>

  <p><em>Farquar Shaw</em>, aged about 35 Years, unmarried, was born in the
    Parish of <em>Rothmurchius</em> in <em>Strathspey</em>, and Shire of
    <em>Inverness</em>. His Father, <em>Alexander Shaw</em>, was an honest
    Farmer, but gave his Son no Education, as living at a Distance
    from Schools, and not in a Condition to maintain him elsewhere;
    <em>Farquar</em> lived some time by droving, but meeting with Misfortunes
    in that Business, was reduced, and obliged, for Subsistance, to enlist
    in this regiment, where he has lived till now without any Reproach.</p>

  <p>The Sentence was intimated to them upon <em>Tuesday</em> before their
    Execution. This unexpected Change of their Fortunes, from hopes of
    Life and Liberty, to that of a short Preparation for a violent Death,
    very much shock’d their Resolution; but <em>Samuel</em> less than any of
    them: When the Warder went to acquaint <em>Samuel</em> of this melancholy
    News, he carry’d with him two Centinels, for fear any Accident might
    happen; and after expressing his Concern for being the Messenger
    of such unhappy News, acquainted him, he must die. He started with
    Surprize; and asked, with some Emotion, <em>How must I die? You are to
    be shot, Sir.</em>—Then he reply’d, pretty composedly, <em>God’s Will be
    done; I have brought this upon myself</em>. He then asked, If he might
    be allowed Pen and Ink; and when the Post went for <em>Scotland</em>?
    The Warder told him the Night; but that he could not live to receive
    any Return: He said, he did not want any. He very pleasantly gave the
    Warder what Weapons he had, which were only a small Penknife and a
    Razor: and before the Warder parted with him seem’d to have assumed
    his ordinary Calmness of Mind; and he and the other two, after some
    Reflection, and the Conversation of the Clergy (who from this time
    attended them) were reconciled so much to their Circumstances, as to be
    able to bear the thoughts of Death with great Decency, and Christian
    Resignation to the Will of God.</p>

  <p><em>Samuel</em> owned he had been active at the Beginning of the
    Sedition; but he could not help sometimes thinking, that the great
    Pains he took to influence the Men to return to their Duty afterwards,
    in a great Measure, alleviated his first Crime.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p><em>Malcolm</em>, to the last declared that he never advised any Person
    to go away; on the contrary, that he never was resolved himself,
    till the moment he joined the Men in their March from <em>Finchley
    Common</em>, and then his Reflection was so short, that he scarce knew
    what he did.</p>

  <p><em>Farquar Shaw</em>, in the same manner, declared, That he was no way
    active in raising the Meeting: That he never advis’d any Man to desert;
    deny’d that he presented his Piece to any of the Officers, as it was
    reported. He owned, that he might have utter’d some very passionate
    and indecent Expressions to some of the Officers who commanded him to
    return; but that these expressions did not import a threatening to
    strike any of them.</p>

  <p>But notwithstanding that they all three imagin’d themselves no more
    guilty than the rest of the Prisoners, yet they never once utter’d
    the least Reflection against the Sentence, the Court Martial, or the
    Lords of the Regency; in short, they did not Attribute their Death
    to anything else but the divine Providence of God, to which they
    chearfully submitted, and acquitted all Mankind of their unhappy End;
    of which <em>Farquar Shaw</em> gave a lively Instance: It being reported
    to him, that one Serjeant <em>Mc.Bean</em> had deposed before the Court
    Martial, that he (<em>Shaw</em>) had presented his Piece to him, when
    he commanded him to return to his Duty; and that this Deposition had
    determined the Court Martial to fix upon him in particular; he sent for
    the Serjeant, and very calmly questioned him concerning this Fact; Who
    told him that he had never been an Evidence against him, but own’d,
    that he told some of his Officers, that he (<em>Shaw</em>) had threaten’d
    to strike an officer who commanded him to return to his Duty; and that
    it was probable, the Colonel might receive this Intelligence from the
    Officers, and that by this means it might come to the Knowledge of the
    Court Martial: The Serjeant express’d his Regret, that he should be any
    way instrumental to his misfortunes. But <em>Shaw</em>, in an affable
    Manner, desir’d him to give himself no Uneasiness on that Head: That he
    had neither Spite nor Ill-will at him for what he had said, but would
    die in perfect Love and Friendship with him, and all Mankind: That he
    had sent for him on purpose to make his Mind easy and not to trouble
    himself with needless Reflections, since he heartily forgave him; and
    accordingly parted with him in the most friendly and amicable manner
    and frequently after express’d to me his Concern for the Serjeant, lest
    his Reflections on himself should prejudice him, or make him uneasy.
    This behaviour of his, to the Man whom he was convinc’d had been the
    principal Cause of his Death, must argue a most charitable, forgiving,
    and generous Temper and Disposition of Mind, very seldom to be met with
    in Men of more elevated Stations in Life.</p>

  <p>They all three were Men of strong natural Parts, and religiously
    disposed both from Habit and Principle, the natural Result of a
    good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> Example and early Instruction in the Doctrine and Precepts
    of Christianity; for I received from all of them a great deal
    of Satisfaction when I examined them on the Grounds of our holy
    Religion; and even <em>Shaw</em>, who was perfectly illiterate and
    could neither read nor write, was ignorant of no Christian Doctrine
    necessary to Salvation, or from whence he could draw Comfort in
    his present Circumstance. They were educated, and died Members of
    the Church of <em>Scotland</em>, tho’ they chearfully embraced the
    Opportunity of receiving the Sacrament from the Hands of the Reverend
    Mr <em>Paterson</em>, who officiated for the Chaplain of the Tower,
    after the Form of the Church (<em>sic</em>) <em>England</em>, on the
    <em>Sunday</em> preceding their Execution.</p>

  <p>As their Notions of Religion were sincere, so they expressed the
    greatest Regard for Honesty and Integrity, and thanked God, tho’ they
    were great Sinners, that his restraining Grace had enabled them to
    avoid all vicious and prophane Courses or the offering any Injury to
    their Neighbours in their Persons or Properties; that they hoped they
    had not only the Approbation of (<i>sic</i>) of a good Conscience,
    but the Testimony of their Officers, Friends and Acquaintance, that
    they have lived all their Life-time without Scandal to themselves, or
    Reproach to their Friends, until this unhappy Period, when Rashness,
    without any Mixture of Malice, Cowardice, or Disaffection to his
    Majesty’s Person or Government, had brought their Lives to this
    miserable Catastrophe.</p>

  <p>They applied themselves diligently to the Duty of Prayer and reading
    the Scripture, from the Time of their Sentence, which they said they
    had but too much and too long neglected.</p>

  <p>When they were all three brought to one Ward near the Place of
    Execution, about four o’Clock that Morning, they expressed the greatest
    Affection and Sympathy for one another, each regretting the case of the
    other two more than his own; at the same time encouraged one another to
    Constancy of Mind, and a dutiful Resignation to the Hand of God.</p>

  <p><em>Samuel M‘Pherson</em> ordered three Coffins to be made of fifteen
    Shillings Value each, for which he paid; and <em>Malcolm</em> made a
    Will, which he deposited in the Hands of three of his own Name among
    the <em>Highland</em> Prisoners, some Days before their Execution.</p>

  <p>These three were admitted to visit the Prisoners, who told them that
    they thanked God that they had got the better of the Fears of Death,
    and were prepared to embrace it chearfully; that they thought their
    Case better than that of their Fellows, as they were leaving this World
    in Hopes of Eternal Peace and Happiness, whilst they were to remain
    here exposed to new Temptations and new Troubles in distant and unknown
    Countries, where they would not enjoy Life, but a lingering Death. They
    applied by Petition to several Persons of Quality, of which the two
    following are true Copies.</p>

  <p>Upon the <em>Monday</em> Morning the Governor ordered them to put on
    their Shrouds below their Cloaths, which when done, they immediately
    began to pray, and continued in that Exercise very devoutly and
    fervently till six o’Clock, when they were called out to Execution.
    They walked to the Place close up to the Chapel in the Tower without
    expressing the least Horror or Despondency in their Gaite or
    Countenance, but with a Christian Composure and Resignation of Mind.
    Here <em>Samuel M‘Pherson</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> standing on the Plank which was appointed
    for them to kneel on, with an assured Countenance and in an audible
    Voice, in his own Language, addressed his Fellow-Prisoners that were
    drawn up round the Place of Execution, in this Manner:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><i>My Friends and Countrymen</i>,</p>

    <p>You are not Strangers to the Cause of my Sufferings with these
      my Companions; I hope the Anguish you must feel at the Sight of
      this shocking Scene, will be the last of your Punishment; for I
      am convinced you must think it a Punishment to see us bleed: But
      my Blood, I hope, will contribute to your Liberty; That Thought
      affords me as much Satisfaction as a Soul prepared to take a Flight
      to Eternity can receive from any Earthly Concerns.—Take Example
      from our unfortunate Ends, and endeavour to conduct yourselves so,
      both before God and Man, as your Lives may be long, and your Deaths
      natural. Next to your Duty to God, discharge what you owe your King
      and Country; wipe off this Reproach by a steady Loyalty to his
      Sacred Majesty, and a respectful and obedient Conduct towards your
      Officers.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Having uttered this Speech, he, with his Cousin <em>M‘Pherson</em> and
    <em>Shaw</em>, kneeled down, whilst the Reverend Mr <em>Paterson</em>
    and myself joined in Prayer, kneeling before them on a Plank: When
    Prayers were over, their Faces were cover’d; when Eighteen Soldiers,
    in three Ranks, (Twelve of whom were appointed to do the Execution,
    and the other Six for a Reserve, had been kept out of Sight for fear
    of shocking the Prisoners) advanced on their Tiptoes, and with the
    least Noise possible, their Pieces ready cock’d for fear of the Click
    disturbing the Prisoners, Serjeant-Major <em>Ellisson</em>, (who deserv’d
    the greatest Commendation for this Precaution) waved a Handkerchief
    as a Signal <em>to present</em>; and, after a very short Pause, waved
    it a second time as a Signal <em>to fire</em>; when they all three fell
    instantly backwards as dead; but <em>Shaw</em> being observed to move his
    Hand, one of the Six in Reserve advanc’d, and shot him thro’ the Head,
    as another did <em>Samuel M‘Pherson</em>. After the Execution, an Officer
    order’d three of the Prisoners, Name-sakes of the Deceased, to advance
    and bury them; whom they presently stripp’d to their Shrouds, put them
    in their Coffins, and buried them in one Grave, near the Place they
    were shot, with great Decency. The Officers on Duty appeared greatly
    affected, and three Hundred of the Third Regiment of <em>Scotch</em>
    Guards, who were drawn up in three Lines in the Shape of a half Moon,
    attended the Execution, many of whom, of the harden’d Sort, were
    observed to shed Tears.</p>

  <p>Thus ended this melancholy Scene, which raised Compassion from all, and
    drew Tears from many of the Spectators. They had by their courteous
    Behaviour, gained so much upon the Affections of their Warders, the
    Inhabitants of the Tower, and others that conversed with them, that
    none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> were so hard-hearted as to deny them their Pity, nay, nor hardly
    had any Resolution to see them executed.</p>

  <p>What made this Spectacle still more moving was, that Mixture of
    Devotion, Agony, and Despair that was seen in the Faces and Actions
    of the remaining <em>Highland</em> Prisoners, who were ranged within
    side the Guards. When Prayers began, they all fell on their Knees
    and Elbows, hanging their Heads and covering their Faces with their
    Bonnets, and might easily be observed that they could not refrain from
    the loudest Lamentations. Such a number of young Men, in so suppliant
    a Posture, offering their Prayers so fervently to Heaven, with such
    Marks of Sorrow for the Fate of the unhappy Criminals, had a prodigious
    effect upon the Spectators, and I am hopeful will influence the
    Practice and Conversation of all that saw them; and to the Praise of
    these poor Men, (take from them the Account (<i>sic</i>) their heinous
    transgression of Mutiny and Desertion) I believe their courteous and
    modest Behaviour, their virtuous and pious Principles, and religious
    Disposition, would be no bad Pattern for Men above the Rank of private
    Centinels, and ought to be a severer Reproof to many who live here, and
    have all the Advantages of a liberal Education, and the Example of a
    polite Court; that Men they esteem barbarous, inhabiting a distant and
    barren Country, should outdo them in real politeness, that is, in the
    Knowledge and Practice of the Doctrines of Christianity.</p>

  <p>From hence we may remark, that those who published or propagated so
    many scandalous Reports of these unhappy young Men, must either have
    taken little Pains to inform themselves of the Truth, or must be
    possessed of little Charity, when they load their Memory with so many
    Assertions no way connected with their Crime. But, as this Relation
    is published from the Prisoners’ own Mouths, and attested by a Person
    whose Profession and Character ought to screen him from the Imputations
    of Partiality or Falsehood, it is hoped these Impressions will wear off
    of the minds of the Public, and give place to sentiments of Charity for
    their Crimes, and Compassion for their Sufferings.</p>

  <div class="subheadc large">RECENT DISCOVERIES AT THE TOWER</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Since</span> the time when the late Prince Consort interested himself in
    the restoration and preservation of the Tower, the Commissioners of
    Works and Public Buildings have cleared away, from time to time, all
    useless and modern portions which obscured certain parts of the ancient
    fabric. This work was actually begun in the lifetime of the Prince
    Consort, under the superintendence of Mr Salvin, who still continues
    to be consulted on all the more important restorations. The works are
    now under the superintendence of Mr John Taylor, the Surveyor to the
    Commissioners, who is aided by Major-General Milman, Major of the
    Tower and the resident military commander, all designs being submitted
    to the Sovereign before being carried into execution. The various
    restorations, especially those of the Beauchamp Tower and St Peter’s
    Chapel, have been described in the body of this work.</p>

  <p>During the year, a range of buildings which stood against the east side
    of the White Tower, and believed to have been built in the fourteenth
    or fifteenth century, were pulled down, and it was found that the outer
    walls were of the period generally assigned to the building, but that
    the inner or west wall was of brick. This building, which extended
    on the south side from the south-east turret of the White Tower to
    what was formerly the Wardrobe Tower, and thence in a north-westerly
    direction with a return wall to the north-east turret of the White
    Tower,—had been so altered and patched that it no longer possessed any
    architectural or antiquarian interest, and was entirely removed, except
    those portions of the south walls and the ruins of the Wardrobe Tower,
    which form the north wall of the Tower Armoury, erected in 1826.</p>

  <p>Whilst this work of demolishing was being carried out, an interesting
    discovery was made, Roman tiles and mortar being found, worked up
    into the materials of which these walls were built. At the south-east
    corner, and adjoining the remains of the Wardrobe Tower, a portion
    of Roman wall was disclosed, having three courses of bonded tiles
    showing above the surface of the <i lang="fr">débris</i>. This piece of wall is
    in a direct westerly line with the old city wall, shown in a plan of
    the Tower made in 1597, the demolished buildings likewise appearing
    on this plan, which can be seen in the office of the Commissioners of
    Works. Two inferences are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> possible from the discovery of this Roman
    work; either it is part of the old city wall or the remains of a Roman
    building, and if it is satisfactorily proved to be Roman, it will
    practically settle the contested point as to whether there was ever a
    Roman fortress on the site of the White Tower or not. Holinshed, in the
    third Book of his history of England, quoting both Leyland and Fabyan,
    says, that Belins, who began to reign conjointly with Brennus as King
    of Britain, which was “about the seventh year of Artaxerxes, the
    seventh king of the Persians, builded a haven with a gate within the
    city of Troinovant, now called London. This gate was long after called
    Belins gate, and at length, by corruption of language, Billingsgate. He
    builded also a castle westward from this gate (as some have written)
    which was long time likewise called Belins Castell, and is the same
    which we now call the Tower of London.” It was pointed out in the
    first volume of this work that Fitzstephen declared the White Tower
    to have been built by Julius Cæsar, and that the mortar used in the
    building was “tempered with the blood of beasts,” but the Roman habit
    of mixing powdered tiles with their mortar, may have given rise to this
    theory. Stowe, in his survey of London about 1076, says, that William
    the Conqueror caused the present White Tower to be erected at the
    south-east angle of the city wall, which would be the actual spot where
    the fragment of the recently discovered Roman wall now stands.</p>

  <p>On removing the southern wall of this building, it was found that it
    was built up to, and not bonded into the south-east turret of the White
    Tower, which forms the apse of St John’s Chapel. When it was taken
    down, the original stone-work of the White Tower was laid bare. It is
    quite honeycombed by age, Sir Christopher Wren having, of course, been
    unable to reface it as he did the exposed portions of the Tower.</p>

  <p>The Cradle Tower, which is the third tower on the southern side of
    the outer Ballium wall, the others being the Develin and the Well
    Towers, was opened out and restored in the year 1878. Before its
    restoration, the southern wall was closed up, the only apertures being
    two loopholes. There was nothing to indicate that it ever had any
    connection with the moat, and the only access to the interior was on
    the north side, within the Ballium wall. It was used as a gunpowder
    store, and was only one storey in height, no trace remaining of the
    second storey which originally existed. The first step taken was to
    remove the whole of the masonry which had been built up against the
    Tower; this disclosed the old front as well as an arch on the south
    side. The return walls extended ten feet, and were built with their
    southern face in the moat, having two half arches turned against the
    moat wall, and when the masonry blocking up the arch in the south wall
    and these two half arches was removed, it at once became evident that
    formerly the water in the moat had flowed through the half arches and
    across the centre arch. By clearing away this masonry the wall of the
    moat itself was disclosed, and was found to be of an earlier date than
    the architecture of the Tower itself. On the ground floor there is a
    chamber with a finely groined roof of the late thirteenth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>or early
    fourteenth century. The following is the actual restoration done to the
    Cradle Tower. The wall built up in the moat under the centre arch and
    under the two half-turned arches has been cleared away, and the outer
    walls have all been restored to their original condition. An additional
    storey and turret have been erected on the same plan as the old
    building. The corbels in the groined roof of the ground floor chamber,
    which were broken off, have been replaced by new ones copied from a
    single corbel that remained. A wooden grating, after the pattern of an
    old doorway in the Byward Tower, has been fitted to the central arch,
    whilst the space between that arch and the moat has been boarded over.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A further discovery was made during the restoration of this tower. In
    the space between the bridge over the moat to the east of the Cradle
    Tower and the Well Tower, stood a modern building used as a storehouse
    by the Ordnance Department, and this being pulled down, excavations in
    its foundations, made by the Board of Works, have disclosed a brick
    paving and some loopholes in the outer Ballium wall, which has helped
    to identify this space as the site of the garden belonging to the
    Queen’s apartments, when the royal palace stood within the Tower walls.
    This palace occupied the space bounded by a line running exactly from
    the south angle of the White Tower to the Broad Arrow Tower, thence
    south along the inner Ballium wall to the Salt Tower, thence west to
    the Wakefield Tower, and north to the south-west angle of the White
    Tower. A portion of this space is now occupied by the Ordnance Stores
    and the Control Office. Nearly opposite to, and to the west of the
    Cradle Tower, and on the south side of the royal Palace, stood the
    Lanthorn Tower (now rebuilt). The Queen’s apartments extended from
    the Lanthorn Tower to the south-east angle of the White Tower, and
    the space recently cleared, formed the Queen’s private garden, the
    loopholes in the Ballium wall bounding the garden on the south side
    giving a view of the river.</p>

  <p>From these discoveries it would appear that the Cradle Tower was the
    entrance to the Queen’s apartments from the river, and the opinion is
    confirmed by the fact that the inner faces of the walls on which the
    centre arch stands, are worked and pointed as outside facing, probably
    to withstand the action of the water as they would be covered when
    the moat was full. There is space above the arch for a portcullis and
    grooves in the jambs, but it is not large enough for portcullis slides.
    In the entrance on the north or land side, however, both the space and
    grooves show that there was a portcullis there, and the chamber on the
    east side has no outlet, except into the centre chamber or gateway—from
    which it would seem that it was a guard-room for the use of a warder
    while on duty at the gate. And the name of the Tower strengthens this
    idea, “Cradle” being the old Saxon word “cradel,” meaning a movable
    bed. The hypothesis is that there was a hoist or lift by which a boat,
    after passing through the archway, was lifted on to the floor of the
    gateway. On comparing the groining of the chamber with the groined
    chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> in the Well Tower, the greater beauty of that in the Cradle
    Tower is at once apparent, which would point to its being part of a
    royal dwelling. It is also nearly opposite the site of the Lanthorn
    Tower, which was the entrance to the Queen’s apartments. The access to
    and from the Thames and the Queen’s apartments of the Palace, would be
    from the Cradle Tower to the moat, under St Thomas’s Tower and through
    Traitor’s Gate, and would be the only communication with the river. In
    1641 the Cradle Tower appears to have been used as a prison, according
    to “A particular of the Names of the Towers and Prison Lodgings in his
    Majesty’s Tower of London, taken out of a paper of Mr William Franklyn,
    sometime Yeoman Warder, dated March 1641,” in which appears, “Cradle
    Tower—A prison lodging, with low gardens where the drawbridge was in
    former times.”</p>

  <p>The War Office have determined to build stores on the Queen’s gardens,
    and consequently the loopholes in the old Ballium wall will be blocked
    up. The site will thus be lost for further investigation, and as the
    Office of Works has no power to prevent these works being carried out,
    all that has been exposed of one of the most interesting portions of
    the older part of the Tower will be lost.</p>

  <div class="subheadc large">THE BLOODY TOWER</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to serious signs of weakness in the upper portions of the walls
    of the Bloody Tower, it was considered an absolute necessity to
    carefully renew the Kentish Rag facing in various places. The work has
    been thoroughly well executed stone by stone, all the old stones that
    were sound being re-used, and the whole of the walls have been greatly
    strengthened by what is technically known as “tying in.” It was found
    that the Tower had been repaired in this same manner about the time
    of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, and probably on more than one occasion. The heart of
    the walling is in excellent preservation, and is the original Norman
    Transitional masonry with a liberal proportion of chalk. The parapet
    has been restored to its original embattlemented character. A brick
    wall, which had closed the historical entrance to Raleigh’s Walk for
    the last hundred years, has been cleared away, leaving the passage open
    as in the days of Cranmer and Raleigh; this wall was built to prevent
    the south-west angle of the Tower falling down, and was an economical
    vandalism on the part of the authorities of the time. Another act of
    vandalism was committed by some former occupant of the Tower, who
    had cut out a cupboard for blacking brushes in the solid masonry
    immediately behind the springing of the large arch over the portcullis,
    thereby seriously jeopardising the stability of the arch; happily this
    has been remedied by the recent restoration. A fine arch over the
    northern portcullis that had completely disappeared, has been replaced,
    and early English Gothic windows of stone with lead lights have been
    fixed throughout the Tower, in the room of the Georgian windows with
    common double-hung deal sashes. Stone chimney-stacks have also taken
    the place of the incongruous chimney-stacks of brick, and a very
    interesting octagonal stone turret, which had been patched with brick,
    has been restored to its original condition. This turret is circular
    inside, and is about five feet in diameter; a curious internal window
    was found about a foot higher than Raleigh’s Walk, and as it answers no
    purpose, it is supposed that it was used for supervising the prisoners.
    In a jamb of the recess immediately over the northern portcullis
    several inscriptions were brought to light, but of these only the
    letters R. D. were legible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> which, seeing the acquaintance that both
    Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, or Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester,
    had with the Tower, has not unnaturally led to the conclusion that the
    initials belong to one or other of these royal favourites.</p>

  <p>The Bloody Tower is of the Norman Transitional period, but the groining
    as well as the gates on the south side—those on the north side have
    been removed—are Tudor. The massive bottom rails of these gates were
    destroyed to allow of an injudicious raising of the road surface many
    years ago. It is said that the road was raised from two to three feet,
    probably to overcome some difficulty of draining, but whatever the
    reason, the fine gates suffered both in effect and materially. On the
    west front of the Tower there is an early English doorway which has
    been “Tudorised,” its outer arch being modern Norman Transitional.</p>

  <p>The original freestone used in the building of the Bloody Tower was
    procured from the neighbourhood of Red Hill, and in the old records is
    called “Rygate” stone. It is known at the present time as Gatton, but
    the quarries are no longer worked. The fine old arches over the main
    entrance are still in this “Rygate” stone, an interesting survival,
    since the whole of the external stone dressings in this material on the
    Tower were superseded by Caen stone from Normandy in the reign of Henry
    <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> This was a deplorable error of judgment, for notwithstanding the
    enormous amount of Caen stone used throughout the Tower in this reign,
    scarcely a trace of it now remains. The modern restorations to the
    interior have been carried out in the “pinny bed of Chilmark,” a stone
    closely resembling the Rygate or Gatton stone, but much more durable,
    whilst Kelton stone from the neighbourhood of Rutland has been employed
    for the battlements and other external dressings. All the main walling
    was carried out in Kentish Rag stone, which was procured from the
    contractor who built the new guard buildings for the War Department. In
    the records of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>’s time, this Kentish Rag is called the “hard
    stone of Kent.” The stone used in those days was undoubtedly superior
    to that used by Salvin over fifty years ago, as is shown by the
    comparison between the restored Beauchamp Tower and the White Tower.
    Soft stones, such as Caen or Bath, absorb a great deal of moisture, and
    their injudicious use consequently hastens the decay of any building
    in which they are used. Much of the mischief in the Bloody Tower was
    doubtless caused by the decay of the Caen stone, and also the neglect
    in pointing the joints. It is generally thought amongst those most
    concerned, that the restoration of the Bloody Tower is the most careful
    and complete of any of the works of preservation carried out in the old
    fortress, and it is now judged to be safe from all fear of collapse.</p>

  <div class="subheadc large">STAINED GLASS IN THE TOWER</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A quantity</span> of stained glass panels were found in the crypt of St John’s
    Chapel, in which some interesting and valuable fragments, mostly
    incomplete in themselves, of heraldic glass of the sixteenth century
    and of small pictorial subjects, were mixed with modern and valueless
    glass of subordinate design. The whole was carefully examined by Messrs
    John Hardman, who separated the ancient from the modern glass, and
    using delicate leads to repair the numerous fractures of the former,
    and setting the various fragments in lozenges of plain glass, filled
    the eight windows of the Chapel with the following subjects:—</p>

  <p>The first window in the south front, entering from the west.—A coat of
    arms with the words “Honi soit qui mal y pense” around it on the upper
    portion; a sepia painting in the centre representing the Deity and two
    angels appearing to a priest, with flames rising from an altar. In the
    lower portion is another sepia painting with the Deity depicted with
    outstretched arms, one hand on the sun, the other on the moon, and the
    earth rolling in clouds at the feet. This is generally supposed to be
    emblematical of the Creation, but has been suggested as representative
    of the Saviour as the Light of the World.</p>

  <p>The second window has a head and bust near the top, with a peculiar cap
    and crown. The centre is a sepia representing the expulsion of Adam
    and Eve from the Garden of Eden, and the guardian angel. At the bottom
    there is another sepia depicting a village upon a hill, probably a
    distant view of Harrow.</p>

  <p>The third window has at the top a figure of Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> in sepia; in the
    centre a knight in armour, skirmishing, and at the bottom what appears
    to be a holly bush with the letters H. R.</p>

  <p>The fourth window has a negro’s head with a turban in the upper
    portion; in the centre a sepia of Esau returning from the hunt to seek
    Isaac’s blessing, Rebecca and Jacob being in the background. Near the
    bottom is another sepia of the exterior of a church, probably Dutch.</p>

  <p>The fifth window, and the last of the series facing south, has a coat
    of arms and motto like those in the first window; in the centre, a
    sepia of the anointing of David by Samuel; and near the bottom, Jehovah
    in clouds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> with the earth and shrubs bursting forth. This is probably
    emblematical of the Creation.</p>

  <p>The south-east apsidal window has the coat of arms and royal motto as
    before, with two smaller coats of arms and the same motto below, a
    royal crown and large Tudor rose being near the bottom.</p>

  <p>The eastern window (in the centre of the apse) has a crown with
    fleur-de-lys and leopards at the top, and in the centre the small
    portcullis of John of Gaunt and the wheatsheaf of Chester. These are by
    far the best heraldic devices in the whole series of windows.</p>

  <p>The north-east window has a very imperfect coat of arms with
    fleur-de-lys and leopard, as well as two other coats with the royal
    motto. There is also a device which might be taken to represent the
    letter M, but which is probably the inverted water bottles of the
    Hastings family. Daggers are quartered upon the other coats of arms.
    At the bottom of this window is a Tudor rose and several fragments of
    glass much confused.</p>

  <p>The glass has been placed in the windows with great care, the subjects
    being made as complete as the broken fragments permitted. Each of the
    eight windows is ornamented with leaded borders.</p>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The Venetian envoy Scaramelli, writing to the Doge from
      London on the 15th May 1603, says, “Et fra tanto non entrera sua
      Maestà in Londra, ma solamente prenderá il possesso della Torre ad
      uso antico, come del Trono et fondomento regale, essendovi in essa il
      Tresoro, et le Armi, ciò è tutte le forze del regno,” which translated
      is, “Meantime his Majesty will not enter London, but will only take
      possession of the Tower, according to ancient custom, as the Throne and
      the foundation of the royal power, for in the Tower are the treasury
      and the armoury—that is, all the strength of the realm.” Two years
      later (on December 8th, 1605) Nicolo Molini, the Venetian Ambassador
      in England, writes to Venice about the Tower, “It is a most remarkable
      fact in this country, that if a nobleman is put in the Tower, he either
      loses his life or ends his days there.” I am indebted to my friend, Mr
      Horatio F. Brown, for these two interesting notices which he found in
      the Venetian State Paper Records.</div>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Among the contemporary dramatists of Shakespeare,
      reference to the Tower is made by Peele, Decker, Webster, and Heywood.
      Peele, in his play of “Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,” where Llewellyn, Prince of Wales,
      mentions how his father broke his neck in attempting to escape from
      what he calls “Julius Cæsar’s Tower.” Decker and Webster refer to
      the fortress in their “Famous History of Sir Thomas Wyatt,” and to
      Guildford Dudley and Jane Grey; Heywood, in his tragedy of “Edward
      <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>,” recounts the murders of Clarence and the sons of Edward, and
      refers to Queen Elizabeth’s imprisonment in the Tower in his “History
      of Queen Elizabeth.” There are also allusions to the Tower and to
      Cromwell, Earl of Essex, and to Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, in the
      “Doubtful Plays.” The above information I have obtained from that rare
      scholar and critic, Dr Furnival. Probably scattered about the country
      are many other inscriptions recording the connection with the Tower of
      the dead, commemorated as was Sir Edward Walsingham on his tomb by his
      son Sir Thomas, in the church of St Nicholas at Chislehurst in Kent:

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> In a series of fac-simile letters of illustrious
      personages published by John Thorne in 1793, is the following from
      Strafford to his wife. It is dated from the Tower the 4th February
      1640—but this date is evidently a mistake, and 1641 must be the year:—

      <p>“Sweet Harte,” he writes, “it is long since I writt unto you, for I am
        here in such trouble as gives me little or noe respett. The Charges now
        cum in, and I am now able, prayse God, to tell you, that I conceave
        there is nothing Capitall, and for the rest I knowe at the worste his
        Ma.ty will pardon all without hurting my fortune, and then we shall
        be happy by God’s grace. Therefore, comfortt your self, for I trust
        these cloudes will pass away, and that we shall have faire weather
        afterwardes. Farewell.—Your loving husband,</p>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Sir Isaac Pennington was a fishmonger, and elected
      Alderman of the Ward of Bridge Without, January 29th, 1638; and became
      Lord Mayor, 1641–42. He was one of the Commissioners who sat upon
      the trial of Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, for which he was condemned to death at the
      Restoration, but was not executed. He was sent to the Tower August
      25th, 1660, where he died on the 17th of the following December.</div>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Sir John Robinson was a clothworker, and elected Alderman
      of Dowgate, December 18th, 1655, and chosen Sheriff, June 24th, 1657.
      He was removed to Cripplegate, December 7th, 1658, and made Lord
      Mayor in 1662, being appointed Lieutenant of the Tower on September
      22nd, 1663. He was the eldest son of the Reverend William Robinson,
      Archdeacon of Nottingham, and was knighted at Canterbury on 26th May
      1660, and created a baronet in the June of the same year.... He was a
      nephew of Archbishop Laud, and married Anne, daughter of Sir George
      Whitmore, a knight and an alderman. He was Lieutenant of the Tower
      from 1661 to 1678. King Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and his Queen, the Queen-mother
      and the Duke and Duchess of York, dined with him at the Clothworkers’
      Hall, where he kept his mayoralty on the 23rd of June 1663. The pageant
      performed by his Company at his inauguration was entitled “London’s
      Triumph.” The <i>Gazette</i> of April 23rd to 26th, 1666, contains an
      account of the trial of certain persons for high treason for conspiring
      to kill him and other officers of the Tower, and to fire the city. He
      was a benefactor to the Clothworkers’ Company, who still preserve his
      portrait in their hall.</div>
